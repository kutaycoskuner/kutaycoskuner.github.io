In recent years, developments in the theory and practice of artificial intelligence also brought the debates on creativity, belonging, and authenticity that took place in the past back to the forefront, adding new dimensions to them. A similar debate was on whether photography is art, which took place after the invention of the camera. 

In my opinion, most of the debates related to AI are arising from conceptional ambiguities due to the change of existing definitional boundaries. Roughly, until now, the concepts of machine/robot has existed as of a separate set  that encapsulates certain concepts (maybe decision making might be included amongst), however that did not interfere with actions such as learning and creating directly but contributed to the process indirectly by facilitating, accelerating, or automating repetitive tasks, without undermining the phenomenon of creation, which is often attributed to consciousness. Now, AI has come to refer to a structure that falls in a new grey area where the definitional boundaries between consciousness and machine cross each other, and although AI cannot be confronted as a machine consciousness as envisaged in its ultimate form, we cannot deny that it has become capable of simulating some phenomenon of learning and creation on certain level.

This discussion requires a complex and deepening questioning that cannot be simply skimmed over; we need to reconceptualize the boundaries of concepts such as consciousness, creation, and authenticity. Neither I do think that I have put the necessary mental effort to decompose the complexities of the problematic, nor that I can do so in a short essay. Nevertheless, I will try to share my hypotheses about how AI will affect production processes and how creative professions will be affected by this, even if I do not have a permanent opinion on the subject through events that I observe similarities by looking at historical patterns.


I can answer the question of whether AI can be a part of creative production processes with my personal experience and observations with a direct affirmative response. Today, it is undeniable that AI, through algorithmic trains, can make produce written, visual or auditory assets that people find aesthetic and/or inspiring. Compositions (if you like to avoid the word work) that are evaluated as unique and indistinguishable from human production. Whether the composition or content of what is produced is creative or not is a matter of deeper debate and is beyond the scope of this essay. This structure can produce completely independent of human beings, but it can also contribute to human works. A musician can experiment with different rhythm and melody variations for his music and still maintain a position of control. Visual artists can be inspired by AI-generated structures to enhance their own work. A programmer can concretize the software architecture he/she wants to create with the support of AI. A writer, an academic ... the list could go on. AI allows us, where can transfer a series of tasks that are not repetitive but can still be described as drudgery. It offers us the possibility to multiply and accelerate production processes, experiments, and variations. I see it as a fact from my personal experience that AI's ability to simulate the work of creators today, as well as its capacity to open new dimensions that will trigger creativity.

On the other hand, it brings with it the problem that creators can be harmed and abused depending on the changing definition limits. As an example of this, should we interpret AI as an independent entity,  a participant or a tool in an AI-supported production? Could we call persons presenting the list of inputs that enable AI to produce as artists? Who should own the intellectual property rights to a work produced partially or completely by using AI? How do we determine the given effort and genuinity of a work? While the ownership, originality and copyright problems comes first to be considered on AI-supported productions. How do we know that I did not generated this text with AI? If I get admission to a school with an asset that does not belong to me, am I not usurping the right of someone else who cannot get in with their own production? Unfortunately, currently there are almost none or very limited control mechanisms for the threads generated by AI.If we roughly reconfigure and rasterize the problem, although it promises to foster creative production processes, it also brings with it the dangers of injustice in the distribution of the produced wealth.

As a historical example, the industrial revolution, which developed in successive spurts and was later categorized into four main categories, similarly facilitated and accelerated work processes and promised greater prosperity and freedom (individual time by reducing the work times) for society. But the new wealth produced was not distributed fairly in society. As a consequence, working hours have not been reduced, and we have seen a consumer society, which some interpret as a dystopia, controlled by perception management and legitimising slavery under the guise of the free market, and eventually greed which also lead to environmental problems in a level that it has evolved to life-threatening environmental problems for the world. On another and more shorter example television promised to be able to a platform for mass education and equal opportunity, it became a tool of mass perception control and propaganda machine. Same history once again repeated on the so-called free platform youtube. In theory these platforms still bear really high potentials  than their current use. However, in practice although we have some good examples, they are rare. In fact, we can even observe the negative use of AI right now. Some countries are trying to create a mass surveillance management with a citizenship points system. Normally, the biggest problem with mass surveillance is the processing of the data that is being recorded. But today's artificial intelligence algorithms make it possible to process this data, enabling a dystopian system under absolute authority. However, although that I am pessimistic about the future, I consider that we should embrace and adapt the AI in ourlives as it is promising the highest possible creation of human mind that is being able to create new consciousness for the first time. On the other hand, even if we don't want to accept it, it's clear that AI technology as a phenomenon will become more and more a part of our lives. It is just futile to ignore or stands against it. Like the industrial revolution, I think AI will destroy some professions, change others and create some new ones.

On conclusion, I think AI has the potential of enhancing and contributing creative workflows. However, at the same time I cannot be optimistic about the future, I consider that power of AI will not be distributed justly among the society and eventually as a result, will harm the creators through reducing their share from the production process or eliminating them completely as a result of human greed. On an individual level, instead of rejecting AI and closing ourselves off, I think we need to open ourselves to this new phenomenon and adapt to new possibilities, workflows and ways of thinking.

Add
JMC tanimina gore matematiksel olarak ifade edebilsigimiz her sureci tanimlayabiliyoruz bu noktada bir gun bilince ulasacsgi konusunda da suphem yok. 

Bir diger sorun ise ai trainlerinde kullanilan veri setlerinde izin alinmamasi. Bunu gercek bireyler dahilinde baktigimizda, bir baskasinin yaptigi sanat eserini goren sanatci istemli veya istemsiz olarak esinlenebilir burda alinti

Malesef su an burada somut cizgilerden su anda bahsetmek mumkun degil. Fakat arz ettigi tehlikelerin yani sira ai creditentials icerisinde aktarilmasi bence ai katki sorunun ana noktasini olusturuyor. 

Control - freedom | randomness quincidentality chaos
Intellectual property laws | ai powered imitations
Legal gray areas to be exploited
Ai as independent entity?
Open access ve adil hale getiriyor rather than blocking | equally accessible 3. Makale
Turing interplay between definitions | to mimic human as machine or vice versa
Turing replace “can machines think” -> “are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?”
