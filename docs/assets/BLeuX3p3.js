A form of correspondence to this idea was brought form correspondence by Oswald Mathias Ungers’ proposal for Berlin; the analogy of archipelago to represent breaking of centralization, to prevent aagglomeration of all functions and possibilities of the city in a single central location. In our consideration, the form of an archipelago not only represents the focal point of the stage (break of hierarchy) but also allows us to blend definite distinction between the stage and the auditorium to increase interactivity. In another aspect, the use of archipelago is to allegorize the work of Ungers as creating a node or point of attraction within Berlin, through emphasizing and revitalizing the potential of public space in Plänterwald."},{"content_type":"title","visibility":true,"style":"narrativ-text-full","content":"Context: Berlin, Spreepark"},{"content_type":"image","visibility":true,"style":"narrativ-img-left","content":"../images/arch_archipelago/context_spreepark_1_by_orthrin_deoe61j-pre.png","caption":"Historic map of Spreepark, 1926 (Reference Content)","slider":true},{"content_type":"text","visibility":true,"style":"narrativ-text-right","content":"In our context, between from 1991 to 2001 as a result of rise of neoliberal policies in the world, Spreepark represents a model of privatized the public space.
