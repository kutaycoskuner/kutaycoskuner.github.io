To win the game, good strategy with the factor of luck must be present together. The game can be played at different difficulty levels depending on the preference of the player group.\r\n\r\n__Disclaimer:__ The game draft is in the hypothetical phase. As it has not been tested, it may contain unforeseen logical problems or imbalanced cases.\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\nThe game space is created through combining hexagonal cards (module or dichotomy cards) to form a big hexagon form (map or board). Dichotomy cards are arranged randomly on the hexagonal game map. This condition introduces the factor of luck and creates an slightly different variation for each game. Map size is adjusted to include 13 module cards on the diagonal. Each session is aimed to last between 25-40 minutes to avoid the game becoming repetitive and overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Game Board](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/gameboard.png)\r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 1: Gameboard </div> \r\n\r\n\r\nEach player starts on a corner of the hexagonal map. Players' positions relative to each other are positioned so that they are uniformly distributed across the game board.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/player_placement.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 2: Player Placement </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Mechanics\r\nEach player starts the game with five basic stats. These are Health, Hunger, Stamina, Strength and Speed.  Dichotomy cards show the player's position on the map. Only one player can be on a card at a time. Rotating on clockwise, players move by choosing one of the cards adjacent to their current dichotomy card. Each dichotomy card gives one negative and one positive property, e.g. +1 speed, -1 hunger.  Players have stats that affected by dichotomy cards. \r\n\r\n\r\n| Icon            | Stat                    | Limit                         |Description                                                                      |\r\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| ![health](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/health.png)     | Heal      | 6 | Allows to player endure bad conditions if reaches zero, player dies.            |\r\n| ![hunger](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/hunger.png)     | Hunger    | 6 | Decreases one on each step if reaches zero player dies.                         |\r\n| ![strength](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/strength.png) | Strength  | 4 | Power of player to handle encounters.

As player moves on the dichotomy card, one applies the stat changes on their card by giving/taking color distincted stat cardridges. Player cannot fill more than maximum amount of the stat. Each player should explicitly show their stat cards to other players.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Player Sheet and Cartridges](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/player_sheet.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 4: Player Sheet and Stat Cartridges </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n__The game can be won in more in various ways__\r\n- By eliminating all the other players\r\n- Reaching the safe zone in the middle\r\n- By visiting 3 players starting place and acquiring their spawnstones.\r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Cards__ are step-over decisions that affects player stats. It contains minimum 3 basic information. These are: name of the card, positive aspect, and negative aspect.  \r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Card Levels__ There are three groups of dichotomy cards distinguished by color.  These groups are there to prevent players from moving around the map with uniform ease, and to create some alignment rules to prevent randomization from creating cul de sac situations that players lose at the early game. In other words, randomization is intended to introduce the factor of luck into the game, whereas alignment rules are there to prevent chance of being the dominant factor and overriding the player's decisions.\r\n\r\n| Color            | Level                    | Desciption                                                                      |\r\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Green            | Easy                     | Regular trade-off                                                               |\r\n| Yellow           | Medium                   | Unfair  trade-off                                                               |\r\n| Orange           | Hard                     | Extremely unfair trade-off                                                      |\r\n\r\n__Step over preventation__\r\nThe card the player steps on is flipped over and grayed out. This card loses its effect until the player exits the adjacent cards. At the end of each round the non-adjacent cards are reactivated. In order to win the game, the player needs to create a progressive strategy by balancing their stats on the maps and reading the actions of the other players.\r\n\r\n![Dichotomy Card](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/dichotomy_card.png)\r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 5: Dichotomy card (Back and Front) </div>\r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Card Examples__\r\n| Name             | Positive Aspect          | Negative Aspect                                                                 |\r\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Hunt             | +1 Hunger                | -1 Stamina                                                                      |\r\n| Stay             | +1 Energy                | -1 Hunger, No movement                                                          |\r\n| Training         | +1 Strength              | -1 Stamina, -1 Hunger                                                           |\r\n| Teleport         | -2 Energy, -1 Speed      | Move to desired location                                                        |\r\n| Portal           | -1 Energy, -1 Hunger     | Move to designated location (other portal)                                      |\r\n| ...              | ...                      | ...                                                                             |\r\n\r\n- Variations of dichotomy card is to be added considering the balance to extend the complexity of game.\r\n\r\n__Player versus Player__ Player could attack and kill other players. To hit another player, target player should be in the attack range by the player. Attacking another player costs 1 hunger and energy equal to players strength. If attacker players energy lesser than his/her strength, then player hit strength is regarded equivalent to as his/her stamina. Hit amount is decreased from attacked player's health. If it the health of attacked player reaches zero. Attacked player dies and attacker takes the position of attacked player, otherwise positions stays same.  \r\n\r\n# Modes and Variations\r\n- **Complexity Level 1:**\r\n    - There are certain single-use items added on the map with some rules. That enhances the stats extensively beyond limits, or provides unique abiltiy\r\n    - ex. bow, bicycle etc.\r\n\r\n- **Complexity Level 2:**\r\n    - Players have a technology tree and materials among map to create items in complexity level 2.\r\n    - ex. Research cooking, weapon craft\r\n\r\n- **Immortal mode:**\r\n    - the killed player reborns on starting zone. Loses his collected spawnstones\r\n\r\n# Story\r\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, there is scarce of sources to accommodate all. Survivalists compete against each other against each other to live.\r\n\r\n# Theory\r\nThe statement _decisions comes with trade-offs_ holds the subtle message of this game. One of the principles that I have adopted in the late stage of my life as I have learned through experience. I encounter often the falsification about the perception of the concept of decision. As it to be regarded something to gain but at the same time not to lose. A decision, choosing one of the two or more options. It opens up a new path, but it also means that other paths are closed. It might seem about a cruel reality. Yet it bear an austere elegance and beauty because decisions are the mere qualities of character that describes who we are. Accepting the responsibility of two-sided condition of a decision not only make us more mature but progress as a being. As a result, the game aimed to express the statement in an entertaining way.\r\n\r\n# References and Credits\r\n__Visual References__  \r\n1. All figures in the article produced by the author.\r\n2.

With a simple mixed combat and puzzle feature for complex spells. Like a cookbook analogy in programming our character learns simple unitary modular folding techniques to create simple origami pieces, each of which associated with a power word, that could be used combine and casts spells ingame.  This techniques progresss further on a skill tree. It is aimed that the skill tree also resembles what player learned in real life as well. On each chapter player requires to create an origami piece. Writing a mark on number on each fold. At the end opening crafted origami piece on 2D reveals a map on how to solve a puzzle in game.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach power word is associated with a folding technique. Player uses keyboard shortcuts to cast power words. Spells are usually combination of (usually 3 or 4) few power words. In RPG combat player must cast spells. A complex set of power words represent portals as well as origami pieces.\r\n\r\nEach power word is learned through a simple puzzle. \r\n    \r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/skill_tree.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 2: Fold and Power Word Asssociation on Skill Tree <br> (hint: try dark mode) </div>\r\n\r\n# Mechanics\r\n\r\nBasic game mechanics is a adjusted combination of two main mechanics. Those are moderate paced, environmentally interactive top-down RPG game play and puzzle solving.\r\n\r\n__Spell Word Combinations__  \r\nEach spell is combination of one or more power words. During RPG combat, player uses the combination of power words through _button combos_ to cast spell to overcome challenges. This combinations further helps player to solve puzzles through replicating origami pieces in real life.  \r\nExample systems in real games (Ultima Online, Skyrim, Magicka).\r\n\r\n__Progressive Casting__  \r\nCasting a spell requires a small amount of time. Each cast process has three periods. Those are: _fizzle_, _success_, _excession_. With the analogy of cooking, _fizzle_ states represents a failing cast. If player ends casts too early, spell fizzles, simply fails without any effect. After the end of fizzle, _success_ period begins. During success, effect of spell increases exponantially until until excession period. The latest stage of the cast is _excession_ period. _Excession_ state is guaranteed failing cast and harms the player depending on the combination of spells. The harm is maximum at start and decreases parabolically up to half of maximum success effect.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/cast_graph.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 3: Spell Effect Change In Relation To Cast Periods </div>\r\n\r\nOn the combinations, different power words affect the cast time and proportions of the cast periods. Along with the mastery and usage frequency of the player.\r\nThrough the mix of spell word combination and progressive casting, it is aimed to create create precision input button combos, fun to play but hard to master base combat mechanics of the game. \r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/cast_bar.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 4: Periods of Cast Bar </div>\r\n\r\n__Real World Replication__  \r\nPlayer requires to solve a puzzle a to unlock, final chapter battles in game. A typical puzzle is again combination of power words, ingredients or keys to be used on certain sequence or places. This sequence is revealed through creating an origami piece through instructions explored in sub-chapters. On each fold player writes a power word on paper in real world. After completing and unfolding the origami piece, map for solving the puzzle is revealed. The sequence of instructions, and words are randomized to create unique map for each instance of the game.\r\n\r\n__Example Puzzle Chapter__\r\n- Game consist of chapters each chapters corresponds an origami piece, and chapters consists of sub-chapters each of one corresponds to fold-technique. \r\n- During sub-chapter with different hints player learns origami by retrieving knowledge such as which fold-technique to be used, how many times and where. Player could replicate this information step to create origami piece.\r\n- On certain steps, player are given some additional power words (as runes) for portal keys. On this case, the given rune needs to be written on  indicated area before applying the fold.\r\n- Completing the chapter, will result to complete the origami as well. However, to unlock next chapter, player requires to handle a boss fight. The boss fight room always resembles the unfolded paper of origami piece. On certain periods, boss stops and an area is indicated by color or light. On this time player should go to given area and cast the passing power word in given time.  \r\n- If player had replicated given fold techniques in real life, unfolding the origami should reveal the true power words, in that player could use true power word to cast the portal.\r\n- Upon completing successful RPG boss fight with the combination of origami puzzle player defeats the boss and gains access to the new chapter. Along with learning an origami in real life.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/mapping.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 5: Puzzle Solving Steps Depiction </div>\r\n\r\n__Puzzle Generation Steps__  \r\n1. Description selected origami for the chapter as a composition of folding steps.\r\n2. Decision on which steps to write a power rune on fold.\r\n3. Writing of appropriate questline for each fold and rune to reveal map.\r\n4. Design of boss fight mechanics and space that bears resemblance of unfolded origami.\r\n\r\n# Theory\r\n__Environmental Interactions__   \r\nAs a general principle, it is aimed to increase the interaction with the environment for player. Environment is not only frozen entity to move and orient for next encounter but also, something to be aware of and act depending of the requirements of the place. Player should be able to change, alter or impact on the environment. At the same time strategicaly use it for personal progression.  \r\nExample cases:  \r\n- Frost based spells has multipliers to hit greater to wet enemies.\r\n- Player should avoid using fire spells on environment with dry woods to create fire.\r\n- Player should position themselves tactically to avoid impact boulder rolls, and even use this phenomenon to encounter with enemies.\r\n\r\n__Integrated Mini Games__   \r\nOne of the problems that I have encountered in online games, that crafted objects costs lesser than material itself. Which is often wrong compared to the real world. The problem is gathering costs labor, however crafting does not, as a result since the material has variety of usage it worth more. To compete with this problem. It is aimed to set alternative progression mechanics such as crafting to be supported by engraved mini games to include and value them in labor. On further extreme, who whole complex game could be considered as a composition of mini games too.  \r\nExample cases:  \r\n- Progressive casting mechanism given above.\r\n- Lockpicking mechanism in Elder Scrolls series.\r\n- Hacking in Eve Online.\r\n\r\n__Internal Learning Mechanism__  \r\nThe mechanic requirements to solve puzzles or progression is aimed to be engraved in-game as much as possible. Player should not progress with grind with frozen state of mind, but immerse him/herself in the game content and try to solve a problem to make a progress.  \r\nExample casees:  \r\n- Trolls could be killed by using fire spells learned through a book (Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, 2011)\r\n- On crafting, player must adjust the necessary conditions to create best possible variations of weapon. This information could be retrieved from someone, or something from ingame. To avoid duplication of the solution outside of the game. Given sources are randomized every game. On example, to forge a good sword, player should set the temperature to correct level. The level is described as a color of something (for instance a peach) ingame by someone or some text. Player should get a peach to compare colors to see correct level adjustment. \r\n\r\n__Technology and Skill Trees__  \r\nAnother factor to establish an immersive environment is to push player to think and theorycraft the problem space created in-game. To create this environment, I consider, technology, and skill trees are good method to create complexity and considering people to think over variances and new possibilities to play and interract with the game. However, I belive skills trees should not shadow the players control over the character. Fundamental success should still be binded to player.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Sub Systems\r\n__Time and Date__  \r\nA time system tracks day/night cycles and calendar to set events. To bind sense of time to certain events such as puzzles or social/unique events ingame that enhances to create more surrounding environment in parallelity with the idea of Gesamkunstwerk.\r\n\r\n__Inventory__   \r\nAs a fundamental aspect of any role-playing game inventory system is aimed to include in Swapfold. To be able to progress on character, use of materials to create more powerful objects and increase environmental interaction.\r\n\r\n__Procedural Environment Generation__   \r\nDescribing environment as modules and computationally bind this parts to describe seamlessly transitive places. The idea is to create relatively unique experience on each seed, as well as preventing the rote progression. \r\n- Example games using described system: Diablo series, Valheim, Don't Starve\r\n\r\n__Controlled Randomization__\r\n- Map randomization: As a part of prodecural environment creation parts of the map is randomly customized\r\n- Puzzle randomization: To prevent same written guide to pass the game without playing it. The fold hints are given randomly to form a unique form for each puzzle instance.\r\n\r\n# References and Credits\r\n__Visual References__\r\n1. _Figure 1._ Basic level origamis selected for each chapter.

While the first three chapters contain my work on game design, in this chapter that I added later, I tried to list the reasons why I wanted to make a game. If you are not willing to read a relatively long essay, you can skip this section. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Game as Total Work of Art\r\nI have great affection for analyzing and creating things. Since the childhood I found myself in virtual dimensions of computer games as a vast field of exploration. I am amazed by how people combined designed systems and worlds using mathematics and art to resemble either life itself or non-existent world out of their imaginations.\r\n\r\nDuring my master education I have meet with various concepts and persons that contributed me a lot. One of these concepts were Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art. Concept coined by Richard Wagner to describe what he aimed to create rather than aesthetic experience, a new dimension that could surround the experiencing person and make them to feel something immersive and new. I was very excited by this concept because it clearly articulated the idea that imagination and artistic production could offer something more than an aesthetic experience that I was enthusiastic about.\r\n\r\nAlthough Wagner aimed to create this through the medium of opera, today many considers cinema as the new form of total work of art. Cinema is powerful enough for us to feel and experience completely new out of this world. I have no objection to the opinion that cinema. However when I first heard about the concept, first thing come to my mind was Ultima Online. An overengineered mmorpg by Richard Garriott was able to create this dimension for me, with a further point that cinema could not reach in that time, the interaction. Cinema could make people cry, to experience something new but they are rarely include viewer as participant to their world (There are some discrete limited examples such as Black Mirror). In my experience, computer games and architecture are proven to be able to carry the potential of Gesamkunstwerk. They are capable to create, through an extended level of interaction, one could experinnce new world and beyond, one could interact with it though decisions and characteristic features. However due the required complexity of these works, we rarely encounter such games. As a result, I have always had the desire to pass on my experience to others as if I had seen a new color. In order to show people that another life and a better world is possible, the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk offers the power to express this and computer games offer a method.\r\n\r\n## Platform for Experimentation\r\nSecondly, in 2016 I met with a youtube channel Primer by Justin Helps.  He is simulating famous theories through animation, statistics, and computer science. On the one hand, I think the way he presents his thought experiments with statistically based proofs, and on the other hand, the way he expresses it in a clear and very understandable way, and the way he presents it with effort and visualization, I think creates extraordinary works. What the Primer videos made me realize is that they provide an extraordinary platform for data generation, experimentation, and scientific inference in sociology, economic and public science in my analysis of online gaming experiences.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, online games of a certain size and complexity have economies that are like small-scale simulations of real life. By analyzing the ledgers in these economies and analyzing the data, we can clearly observe behavioral patterns that parallel those in the real world. Can people's behavior change from cooperative to cooperative in crisis situations (See Corrupted Blood Incident - World of Warcraft) How does human behavior change with inflation (Gold Pruning Events - Ultima Online/ World of Warcraft) Can we channel the time people spend having fun into producing functional scientific output (See Project Discovery - Eve online). Some of the conclusions that I find functional in life are that money is not a measure of value but a representation mechanism, and that labor is the real value. The system of risk and reward and the balance of supply and demand advocated by classical economics does not work linearly. To summerize, I think that game platforms can exist as potential and powerful platforms for scientific experimentation and production other than private beneficial purposes, but that this potential is rarely used, although there are examples. As a game designer, I think this potential should be assessed.\r\n\r\n## Platform for Education\r\nI hesitate to add the third aspect, because previous attempts with similar premises, such as television and youtube, have not worked out so well, but I will add it anyway because it is my peak goal. I think games as an educational platform can contribute to social development to form a better society and environment. \r\n\r\nIn nature, when we look at the concept of game, we see that it works as a simulation that gives the living being the abilities that prepare it for life. I think a similar template can be applied to counter the current notion of games as a market commodity where entertainment is sold. I think that games have the potential to be not only a means of transmitting functional knowledge, as in the case of survival in nature, but also educational platforms that offer causality to create a more just society, to become bettere over nature and sustainable environment. To extend this idea, I would like to example from architecture (another Gesamkunstwerk) through famous illustration of Panopticon by Michael Foucault. \r\n\r\nFoucault has seen architecture as inevitably political action. In other words, architecture changes society through subtle political statements through organizing, controlling, and defining the space. Foucault uses a blatant instance of the Panopticon to concrete his argument. Panopticon is a prison design produced as an idea experiment. The biggest problem of surveillance mechanisms is the numerical proportional difference between the actors. In other words, it is not possible to have a guard watch each prisoner, and it is not efficient either. Panopticon is a cylindrical prison, where in the middle, stands a watchtower for the guards, and prisoners in its perimeters. The overhead light prevents the prisoners from seeing the guards, while the guards are at any angle could observe each individual prisoners. Prisoners cannot know if they are being watched, as they cannot see the guards. Even if the guards are few in number, the prisoners have to act on the assumption that they are being watched. At the theoretical level, the problem is solved only with the spatial organization, namely architecture. Foucault has used it to express how architecture can shape human behavior through an extreme example like Panopticon. Although Foucault's example is negative and pessimistic, this potential is not only there to establish autocratic control, but to convey the causality phenomena that will make it possible to produce more free, just and sustainable environment for all. Indeed, as a more positive example, psychologist and educator Loris Malaguzzi referred to the place as the \"third teacher\" on the educational buildings, as it is referred to architecture could play a role to establish values such as equality, justice, freedom for all living beings and nature. <sup>1</sup>\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I think I have experimented with the idea that games can be educational platforms. To exemplify at the individual level, I got my thoughts on economics and sociology from my abstracted simulation experiences in games. I have seen how people act in crisis situations. Games taught me the difference between fact and image, and awareness of the ideas such as rhetoric over logic <sup>2</sup>, on social experiences. I learned the second language English through games, and the idea of the dichotomous relationship between chaos and order <sup>3</sup>, which later contributed to my master thesis in architecture. Regardless of the right or wrong of my thoughts, I think that games had a great impact on the formation of my intellectual identity.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I believe that games have the potential to be a complete work of art, a platform for experimentation, as well as a platform for education and social development, but this potentials are rare except some subtle extraordinary cases. Just like the value that I have gained from games, I think that by creating works with this potential, I can add new dimensions to the perception of the game and create works that could add value to humanity that has not only have artistic and scientific value but also something that could allows us to create a better, self-sustainable, and fair society.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of my game design portfolio.   \r\nThank you for your time and attention. :)\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n1.

To win the game, good strategy with the factor of luck must be present together. The game can be played at different difficulty levels depending on the preference of the player group.\r\n\r\n__Disclaimer:__ The game draft is in the hypothetical phase. As it has not been tested, it may contain unforeseen logical problems or imbalanced cases.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\nThe game space is created through combining hexagonal cards (module or dichotomy cards) to form a big hexagon form (map or board). Dichotomy cards are arranged randomly on the hexagonal game map. This condition introduces the factor of luck and creates an slightly different variation for each game. Map size is adjusted to include 13 module cards on the diagonal.

These are: name of the card, positive aspect, and negative aspect.  \r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Card Levels__ There are three groups of dichotomy cards distinguished by color.  These groups are there to prevent players from moving around the map with uniform ease, and to create some alignment rules to prevent randomization from creating cul de sac situations that players lose at the early game. In other words, randomization is intended to introduce the factor of luck into the game, whereas alignment rules are there to prevent chance rom being the dominant factor and overriding the player's preferences.\r\n\r\n| Color            | Level                    | Desciption                                                                      |\r\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Green            | Easy                     | Regular trade-off                                                               |\r\n| Yellow           | Medium                   | Unfair  trade-off                                                               |\r\n| Orange           | Hard                     | Extremely unfair trade-off                                                      |\r\n\r\n__Step over preventation__\r\nThe card the player steps on is flipped over and grayed out. This card loses its effect until the player exits the adjacent cards. At the end of each round the non-adjacent cards are reactivated. In order to win the game, the player needs to create a progressive strategy by balancingg their stats on the maps and reading the actions of the other players.\r\n\r\n![Dichotomy Card](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/dichotomy_card.png)\r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 5: Dichotomy card (Back and Front) </div>\r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Card Examples__\r\n| Name             | Positive Aspect          | Negative Aspect                                                                 |\r\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Hunt             | +1 Hunger                | -1 Stamina                                                                      |\r\n| Stay             | +1 Energy                | -1 Hunger, No movement                                                          |\r\n| Training         | +1 Strength              | -1 Stamina, -1 Hunger                                                           |\r\n| Teleport         | -2 Energy, -1 Speed      | Move to desired location                                                        |\r\n| Portal           | -1 Energy, -1 Hunger     | Move to designated location (other portal)                                      |\r\n| ...              | ...                      | ...                                                                             |\r\n\r\n- Variations of dichotomy card is to be added considering the balance to extend the complexity of game.\r\n\r\n__Player versus Player__ Player could attack and kill other players. To hit another player, target player should be in the attack range by the player. Attacking another player costs 1 hunger and energy equal to players strength. If attacker players energy lesser than his/her strength, then player hit strength is regarded equivalent to as his/her stamina. Hit amount is decreased from attacked player's health. If it the health of attacked player reaches zero. Attacked player dies and attacker takes the position of attacked player, otherwise positions stays same.  \r\n\r\n### Modes and Variations\r\n- **Complexity Level 1:**\r\n    - There are certain single-use items added on the map with some rules. That enhances the stats extensively beyond limits, or provides unique abiltiy\r\n    - ex. bow, bicycle etc.\r\n\r\n- **Complexity Level 2:**\r\n    - Players have a technology tree and materials among map to create items in complexity level 2.\r\n    - ex. Research cooking, weapon craft\r\n\r\n- **Immortal mode:**\r\n    - the killed player reborns on starting zone. Loses his collected spawnstones\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, there is scarce of sources to accommodate all. Survivalists compete against each other against each other to live.\r\n\r\n### Theory\r\nThe statement _decisions comes with trade-offs_ holds the subtle message of this game. One of the principles that I have adopted in the late stage of my life as I have learned through experience. I encounter often the falsification about the perception of the concept of decision. As it to be regarded something to gain but at the same time not to lose. A decision, choosing one of the two or more options. It opens up a new path, but it also means that other paths are closed. It might seem about a cruel reality. Yet it bear an austere elegance and beauty because decisions are the mere qualities of character that describes who we are. Accepting the responsibility of two-sided condition of a decision not only make us more mature but progress as a being. As a result, the game aimed to express the statement in an entertaining way.\r\n\r\n### References and Credits\r\n__Visual References__  \r\n1.

Players must replicate actions on real world in order to find some solutions to puzzles. The main idea of the game to establishing a ground to show that games has potential as an environment to be a platform of education. On the completition of the game player should be able to learn few origami pieces through the method of associative learning.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/chapters.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 1: Basic level origamis selected for each chapter </div>\r\n\r\n### | Story\r\nOur player is an apprentice mage who has to train portals. His supervisor gives him extraordinary tasks to complete. In order to understand how interdimensionality works you should be able to accurately represent and simulate them in simple dimensions. Idea comes from quartenions. So he/she starts to learn to play with simple tasks. However, during one of his tasks something goes wrong and a portal opens to demonic world of caridia. Now our characters needs to focus on his training to overcome this problem.\r\n\r\n### | Base Gameplay\r\nGameplay starts with a simple platformer game with moving around and exploring the world. With a simple mixed combat and puzzle feature for complex spells. Like a cookbook analogy in programming our character learns simple unitary modular folding techniques to create simple origami pieces, each of which associated with a power word, that could be used combine and casts spells ingame (ultima online / magicka / skyrim).  This techniques progresss further on a skill tree. It is aimed that the skill tree also resembles what player learned in real life as well. On eah chapter player requires to create an origami piece. Writing a mark on number on each fold. At the end opening crafted orgami piece on 2D reveals a map on how to solve a puzzle in game.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach power word is associated with a folding technique. Player uses keyboard shortcuts to cast power words. Spells are usually combination of (usually 3 or 4) few power words. In rpg combat player must cast spells. A complex set of power words represent portals as well as origami pieces.\r\n\r\nEach power word is learned through a simple puzzle. \r\n    \r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/skill_tree.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 2: Fold and Power Word Asssociation on Skill Tree </div>\r\n\r\n### | Mechanics\r\n\r\nBasic game mechanics is a adjusted combination of two main mechanics. Those are moderate paced, environmentally interactive topdown rpg game play and puzzle solving.\r\n\r\n__Spell Word Combinations__  \r\nEach spell is combination of one or more power words. During rpg combat, player uses the combination of power words through _button combos_ to cast spell to overcome challenges. This combinations further helps player to solve puzzles through replicating origami pieces in real life.  \r\nExample systems in real games (ultima online, skyrim, magicka)\r\n\r\n__Progressive Casting__  \r\nCasting a spell requires a small amount of time. Each cast process has three periods. Those are: _fizzle_, _success_, _excession_. With the analogy of cooking, _fizzle_ states represents a failing cast. If player ends casts too early, spell fizzles, simply fails without any effect. After the end of fizzle, _success_ period begins. During success, effect of spell increases exponantially until until excession period. The latest stage of the cast is _excession_ period. _Excession_ state is guaranteed failing cast and harms the player depending on the combination of spells. The harm is maximum at start and decreases parabolically up to half of maximum success effect.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/cast_graph.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 3: Spell Effect Change In Relation To Cast Periods </div>\r\n\r\nOn the combinations, different power words affect the cast time and proportions of the cast periods. Along with the mastery and usage frequency of the player.\r\nThrough the mix of spell word combination and progressive casting, it is aimed to create create precision input button combos, fun to play but hard to master base combat mechanics of the game. \r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/cast_bar.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 4: Periods of Cast Bar </div>\r\n\r\n__Real World Replication__  \r\nPlayer requires to solve a puzzle a to unlock, final chapter battles in game. A typical puzzle is again combination of power words, ingredients or keys to be used on certain sequence or places. This sequence is revealed through creating an origami piece through instructions explored in sub-chapters. On each fold player writes a power word on paper in real world. After completing and unfolding the origami piece, map for solving the puzzle is revealed. The sequence of instructions, and words are randomized to create unique map for each instance of the game.\r\n\r\n__Example Puzzle Chapter__\r\n- Game consist of chapters each chapters corresponds an origami piece, and chapters consists of sub-chapters each of one corresponds to fold-technique. \r\n- During sub-chapter with different hints player learns origami by retrieves knowledge such as which fold-technique to be used, how many times and where. Player could replicate this information step to create origami piece.\r\n- On certain steps, player are given some additional power words (as runes) for portal keys. On this case, the given rune needs to be written on  indicated area before applying the fold.\r\n- Completing the chapter, will result to complete the origami as well. However, to unlock next chapter, player requires to handle a boss fight. The boss fight room always resembles the unfolded paper of origami piece. On certain periods, boss stops and an area is indicated by color or light. On this time player should go to given area and cast the true power word.  \r\n- If player had replicated given fold techniques in real life, unfolding the origami should reveal the true power words, in that player could use true power word to cast the portal.\r\n- Upon completing successful rpg boss fight with the combination of origami puzzle player defeats the boss and gains access to the new chapter. Along with learning an origami in real life.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/mapping.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 5: Puzzle Solving Steps Depiction </div>\r\n\r\n__Puzzle Generation Steps__  \r\n1. Description selected origami for the chapter as a composition of folding steps.\r\n2. Decision on which steps to write a power rune on fold.\r\n3. Writing of appropriate questline for each fold and rune to reveal map.\r\n4. Design of boss fight mechanics and space that bears resemblance of unfolded origami.\r\n\r\n### | Theory\r\n__Environmental Interactions__   \r\nAs a general principle, it is aimed to increase the interaction with the environment for player. Environment is not only frozen entity to move and orient for next encounter but also, something to be aware of and act depending of the requirements of the place. Player should be able to change, alter or impact on the environment. At the same time strategicaly use it for personal progression.  \r\nExample cases:  \r\n- Frost based spells has multipliers to hit greater to wet enemies.\r\n- Player should avoid using fire spells on environment with dry woods to create fire.\r\n- Player should position themselves tactically to avoid impact boulder rolls, and even use this phenomenon to encounter with enemies.\r\n\r\n__Integrated Mini Games__   \r\nOne of the problems that I have encountered in online games, that crafted objects costs lesser than material itself. Which is often wrong compared to the real world. The problem is gathering costs labor, however crafting does not, as a result since the material has variety of usage it worth more. To compete with this problem. It is aimed to set alternative progression mechanics such as crafting to be supported by engraved mini games to include and value them in labor. On further extreme, who whole complex game could be considered as a composition of mini games too.  \r\nExample cases:  \r\n- Progressive casting mechanism given above.\r\n- Lockpicking mechanism in Elder Scrolls series.\r\n- Hacking in Eve Online.\r\n\r\n__Internal Learning Mechanism__  \r\nThe mechanic requirements to solve puzzles or progression is aimed to be engraved in-game as much as possible. Player should not progress with grind with frozen state of mind, but immerse him/herself in the game content and try to solve a problem to make a progress.  \r\nExample casees:  \r\n- Trolls could be killed by using fire spells learned through a book (Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, 2011)\r\n- On crafting, player must adjust the necessary conditions to create best possible variations of weapon. This information could be retrieved from someone, or something from ingame. To avoid duplication of the solution outside of the game. Given sources are randomized every game. On example, to forge a good sword, player should set the temperature to correct level. The level is described as a color of something (for instance a peach) ingame by someone or some text. Player should get a peach to compare colors to see correct level adjustment. \r\n\r\n__Technology and Skill Trees__  \r\nAnother factor to establish an immersive environment is to push player to think and theorycraft the problem space created in-game. To create this environment, I consider, technology, and skill trees are good method to create complexity and considering people to think over variances and new possibilities to play and interract with the game. However, I belive skills trees should not shadow the players control over the character. Fundamental success should still be binded to player.\r\n\r\n__Environmental Interactions__  \r\n\r\n\r\n### | Sub Systems\r\n__Time and Date__  \r\nA time system tracks day/night cycles and calendar to set events. To bind sense of time to certain events such as puzzles or social/unique events ingame that enhances to create more surrounding environment in parallelity with the idea of Gesamkunstwerk.\r\n\r\n__Inventory__   \r\nAs a fundamental aspect of any role-playing game inventory system is aimed to include in Swapfold. To be able to progress on character, use of materials to create more powerful objects and increase environmental interaction.\r\n\r\n__Procedural Environment Generation__   \r\nDescribing environment as modules and computationally bind this parts to describe seamlessly transitive places. The idea is to create relatively unique experience on each seed, as well as preventing the rote progression. \r\n- Example games using described system: Diablo series, Valheim, Don't Starve\r\n\r\n__Controlled Randomization__\r\n- Map randomization: As a part of prodecural environment creation parts of the map is randomly customized\r\n- Puzzle randomization: To prevent same written guide to pass the game without playing it. The fold hints are given randomly to form a unique form for each puzzle instance.\r\n\r\n### | References\r\n__Visual References__\r\n1. _Figure 1._ Basic level origamis selected for each chapter.

Moreover as Kate Nesbitt points out paradigms[^1] in \r\nwhich postmodern discourse built upon, focused even more on fixation and rectification of\r\nsocial paradoxes and complications.\r\n\r\nHowever in 21th Century it would not be wrong to say that is unable to follow traces of\r\nhumanitarian aspects in contemporary cities. The touch of architect is concrete on buildings\r\nof prestige such as museums, airports, opera houses and skyscrapers; but rarely visible on\r\nresidential areas, stations, schools and community zones. In other words, places of everyday\r\nlife in which people spend most of their times are not receiving the necessary attention during\r\nthe design process of built environment. As a result mass production occurring as copying\r\nwhich could be considered as failure in different aspects. On phenomenological perspective,\r\nChristian Norberg-Schulz pointed out “Genius Loci” as he states:\r\n\r\n    Man dwells when he can orientate himself within and identify himself within\r\n    environment, or, in short, when he experiences the environment as a meaningful.\r\n    Dwelling therefore implies something more than ‘shelter”. It implies that the spaces\r\n    where life occurs are places, in the true sense of the word. A place is space which has\r\n    a distinct character. Since ancient times the genius loci, or “spirit of place”, has been\r\n    recognized as the concrete reality man has to face and come to terms with in his daily\r\n    life. Architecture means to visualize the genius loci, and the task of the architect is to\r\n    create meaningful places, whereby he helps man to dwell. (Norberg-Schulz, 1979)\r\n\r\nIn this scrutiny, by pointing out Genius Loci, Norberg-Schulz criticizes the what discourse of\r\nmodernism stripped off from built environments mostly caused by inappropriate application\r\nof mass production even if the intentions were opposite. Another aspect of failure unfolded\r\nby Kevin Lynch by this terms “imageability” and “wayfinding” as he states:\r\n\r\n    A distinctive and legible environment not only offers security but also heightens the\r\n    potential depth and intensity of human experience. Although life is far from impossible\r\n    in the visual chaos of the modern city, the same daily action could take on new meaning\r\n    if carried out in a more vivid setting. (Lynch, 1960)\r\n\r\nBeing not able to provide necessary attention to design would also result to generation of\r\nnon-distinctive places which will prevent people from orienting themselves in the city. As a\r\nresult experiencing the city is not a valid notion anymore especially for Generation Z[^2] as it\r\nturned out something to afraid of, a subject of obscurity itself.\r\n\r\nHowever shaping built environment that way is not the choice of architect. Whereas\r\narchitecture is directly related with politics, production of built environment is affected by\r\ncomplex social paradox in which especially in non-developed countries the scope of\r\nproduction prioritize income rather than life that place has to provide. Additionally\r\nsignificance of urban design and autonomy of architecture is underestimated. Therefore, they\r\nare excluded from the production of built environment which they has to be autonomous at\r\nsome extend. In fact even previously mentioned “prestige buildings” are not an exception for\r\nthe situation. The main reason behind being point of interest is marginal advertising potential\r\n(i.e. Profit opportunities) which intended and designated by authoritative power of the capital.\r\nTherefore another intention of modernism turns out as failure as relation with authority does\r\nnot changed but shifted it is figurative form to abstract phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn this paper main scope is to interrogate ill-defined social paradox that resulting\r\nnon-functioning built environment, identify negative qualitative outcomes of situation and\r\npointing out discussions on role of architects and simulating performance or control\r\nmechanisms in order to be able to create better built environment.\r\n\r\n## Changing the Meaning of Architect\r\n\r\nMeaning is an evolving phenomenon by time, culture and society. Additionally, the\r\nmultidisciplinary nature of architecture makes the context of its meaning fragile. In different\r\nintervals of history, architecture partially overlapped by context of engineering, artistry and\r\ncraftsmanship. However changes the zones of overlapping, architecture kept its genuine\r\nintersection zone and defined itself as autonomous discipline. Nonetheless, for further\r\ndiscussions it is beneficial to point out differing point between artist and architect as Le\r\nCorbusier states:\r\n\r\n    The engineer and the architect have to work with other people’s money. They must\r\n    consider their clients and, like politicians,they cannot be too far ahead of their moment.\r\n    The artist, on the other hand particularly the painter, may generally find it nearly\r\n    impossible to live; but if he is able to establish one of those curious compromises by\r\n    means of which he can carry on a lean existence, he is at least free (at times) to project\r\n    himself on paper or canvas without necessary reference to anything or anybody; and to\r\n    make experiment and research for its own sake. (Le Corbusier, 1927)\r\n\r\nAs Le Corbusier pointed the difference; the architect distinguish from the artist at point that\r\nformer has only bounded freedom so content of architect’s work is cannot be discussed\r\nindependent from social context.\r\n\r\n### Confusion of Meaning of Architect In the Society\r\n\r\nThe chain reaction of events started by enlightenment and followed by industrial revolution\r\nresulted the emergence new transitionary social class. Social structure changed by revolutions[^3]\r\n, demanded a built environment to serve life rather than given public space. In 19th century\r\nby the redefinition of modernity architects started to be in service of stated demand in\r\ngeneral. On the other hand, by the scale and improvement of building technologies;\r\nprofessions once they were one under architecture are separated as individual disciplines.\r\nCivil engineering and city planning i.e. urban design could be given examples of this\r\nsegregation. A common misunderstanding maybe because of these historical references,\r\npeople has confusion about what should they expect from architect or what should be the\r\nresponsibilities and competencies of the architect.\r\n\r\nIn another aspect, it is assumed that people has adequate perception when participating\r\nsurveys. However surveys that their methodology bounded to declarations about life\r\nsatisfaction or qualities of built environment are not always providing reliable results. For\r\ninstance, the one could consider the non-functioning built environment as successful that he\r\nor she living in, by comparing with the worse only because of that being not capable to\r\nimagine qualitative superior which architect could provide. Therefore, it is important to\r\neducate people about the context of discipline of architecture in order to be able to foundate\r\nparticipatory[^4] production of built environment. By healthy feedbacks qualities of built\r\nenvironment could be improved ,by teaching the capabilities of design; demand and \r\ncultivation for urban aesthetics[^5] may be provided, welfare, life quality, hygiene, adaptability\r\n(in terms of flora and fauna) and flexibility standards could be expanded.\r\n\r\n### Role of Architect in the Contemporary World\r\nIt is not possible to fit perpetually evolving phenomenon in rigidly defined boundaries.\r\nHowever it is necessity to make a description in order to be able to comprehend the notion\r\nand articulate within the scope of objectivity, fit in the context of social integrity and\r\njurisprudence. Therefore, to concretize by raw description in contemporary world, ideally,\r\nrole of architecture could be summarized to serve society by creating creative, functioning,\r\nadaptive, flexible and pleasing built environment in the scale of autonomous structure\r\ncomplexes which also can speak multidimensional level and has a harmonious role within\r\nenvironment it belongs. Thereby it is important to incarnate the line between other roles\r\ninvolving the production of built environment. In order to point out contextual meaning of\r\ndiscipline of architecture Canan Seyhun states:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When regarded as a discipline, it is necessary to evaluate architecture with regard to\r\n    its various interrelationships. The discipline of architecture has a multidimensional\r\n    character, which assimilates with many theoretical and practical realities. It is possible\r\n    to consider architecture as an art, a profession, a science, or as a discourse; and\r\n    therefore, it is possible to evaluate an architectural work by means of its many levels;\r\n    such as its conceptual, artistic, intellectual, and utilitarian levels. An architectural\r\n    work could be evaluated as an art object; having its own aesthetic characteristics, or as\r\n    a cultural product; reflecting the conditions of the society, or as a utilitarian\r\n    apparatus; satisfying the necessities of intended functions. Not only the tectonic\r\n    properties but also the theoretical origins of it could be assessed. (Seyhun, 2004)\r\n\r\nThus, with accurate precision Seyhun identifies boundaries of discipline within the scope of\r\ncompleteness and correctness. In 21. Century on intellectual level architects actions evolving\r\ninto being curators, activists and critics rather than being in active role of shaping built\r\nenvironment. Reasons of stated situation will be articulated in next chapter.\r\n\r\n## Critique of Social Paradoxes of Present-Day\r\n\r\nIn present-day production of built environment is outcome of complex social structure which\r\npreviously mentioned as ill-defined paradox. According to Pava: “Social paradox is a\r\npervasive, continuing dilemma between incompatible yet interdependent activities (i.e.\r\nbetween regulators and the regulated).” (Pava, 1981)\r\n\r\nPresent-day examples and outcomes will be discussed upon two exaggerated limit points by\r\nopposite perspectives. The former will articulate the absolute autonomy of architect, while\r\nthe latter will mention bypassing the autonomy of architecture i.e. excluding the architect\r\nfrom its product.\r\n\r\n### Absolute Autonomy of Architect\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, since 19th century the architect gained its own autonomy; in fact\r\nwith its expanded jurisdiction, arguably the architect itself turned into a figure of authority\r\nwhich could be explained by lack of control mechanism. Thus, practices of modernus[^6] began\r\nto behave in compulsive attitude rather than given promises of offering a new life, which also\r\ncould be supported by bearing of the discourse of postmodernism. However, following\r\ninterval did not progressed but shifted the situation. The birth of notion, the Starchitect[^7] could\r\nbe an example. Maybe unconsciously but architecture turned out, or at least prioritized being\r\nan object of self-representation instead of the representation of authoritative power.\r\n\r\nIndividuals may choose not to interact with art objects, but this is not a valid case for\r\narchitecture. Thus, unlike the artist who has absolute freedom, the architect cannot prioritize\r\nself-representation in its work. Architecture itself could become an art object; however, since\r\nit has to serve people or bear a social responsibility it has some constraints in which\r\ndistinguishes it from an individual art object. In another fold, such attitude also disrupts\r\nperception of role about architect perceived by the society, as well as the image of architect\r\nfor architects of future and blur the participatory production of built environment which\r\ndiscussed in previous chapter.\r\n\r\n### Excluding Architecture from Production of Built Environment\r\n\r\nAs opposed to former second extremum point could be given example as bypassing the\r\nautonomy of architecture. This condition is more tangible in non-developed countries, but\r\nalso occurring developed countries as well. Hence at some extent especially in less-developed\r\nsocieties on intellectual level the role of architect or designer started to be seen as\r\ninsignificant or easily be replaced, and some professionals claim for being that replacement.\r\nChanging state of autonomy stated by Michael Hays and Lauren Kogod:\r\n\r\n    When the issue of autonomy re-emerged in the 70s, architecture was in the peculiar\r\n    situation of being eroded from within by having become a service industry completely\r\n    determined by the building technology and programmatic demands of the time. On the\r\n    other hand, it had been challenged from outside the discipline by behaviorism,\r\n    sociology, pseudo-positivist history and pseudo-scientific discourses that tried to\r\n    explain architecture away in terms of how people behaved, or what response they\r\n    checked off on a questionnaire. Formal issues had given way to these statistical and\r\n    operational analyses. Architecture found itself without cultural or disciplinary\r\n    specificity... In contemporary vocabulary, we could say that architecture found itself\r\n    deterritorialized. It lost its domain; it lost the cultural realm that it had controlled. It\r\n    had to, therefore, re-territorialize itself by rediscovering, reasserting or reinventing its\r\n    codes. (Hays, 2002)\r\n\r\nIt is possible to observe in everyday life spaces applications of insufficient or non-functioning\r\nbuilt environment which lack the aspects of quality; especially in terms of intrinsic and\r\nintellectual values. Practically all of the cases has a common point of that excluding or not\r\ngiving significant attention to role of architect and urban designer in production of built\r\nenvironment or even the built environment which has to be designed in order to satisfy its\r\nusers needs actually prioritize the income for those who build it. Thereby, it turns out to a\r\ncapital market rather than place to live. Besides if society does not have necessary perception\r\nto demand the architecture which described in previous chapter; our built environments\r\ncannot be developed, even deprogression could possibly observed as well as in the civilization itself. \r\nIt could be summarized as “We shape our buildings and afterwards our\r\nbuildings shape us”. (Churchill, 1941)\r\n\r\n### The Capital as Authoritative Power\r\n\r\nThe Capital mentioned as decisive power in the production of built environment. However if,\r\nas a fact, the income is fundamental parameter of welfare; why is it should not be the\r\nauthority to shape the built environment? Briefly, because of the difference of objectives and\r\nfocus of short-term goals. Competency for the Olympics and resulted urban transformations\r\ncould be an example for the case.\r\n\r\n    Even though the primary purpose of being a host city is to serve as the location for\r\n    sporting events, there must be much more at stake than merely providing a venue for\r\n    sport competitions. Much attention has been given to the economic impact and tourism\r\n    impact of hosting the Olympics which stresses the role of the Games themselves. 'What\r\n    has been neglected is how the Olympics are related to the long-term goals of the city.\r\n    (Hiller, 1998)\r\n\r\nEven if the Olympics provides reliable income and fulfill the expectations of the capital, if\r\nnot planned adaptively; providing a venue for sport competitions will result derelict gaps\r\nwithin the urban texture. Therefore egocentric nature of capital economy does not prioritize\r\nlife which idealistically, the built environment should provide.\r\n\r\n### Possible Negative Outcomes\r\n\r\nIn 21. Century by given reasons, it would be not wrong to say especially in less-developed\r\ncountries everyday built environment is lacking intrinsic, intellectual, aesthetic and even\r\nfundamental functional requirements of place It could be said that there is a serious political\r\nand social problem exists in this situation and its negative outcomes could also be seen by\r\nquantitative measurements. Rigidity of built environment enforces society to fit in the\r\nboundaries of what defined as normal[^8] ; suburbs as bleak strangling points of city, birth of\r\nexurbs[^9] , preference to live and socialize in virtual dimensions, solitary of people living in\r\ncities, obsession of safety, perception of city as a subject of fear, augmented perception[^10] issues\r\n, crime and rise on mental disorders[^11] could be given as examples. By all means\r\nnon-functioning built environment may not be the only reason of those problems but should\r\nbe pointed out as one of the major reasons.\r\n\r\n## Autonomy, Partizipation and Control Mechanisms \r\n\r\nWhen Kaufmann family asked for a house from Frank Lloyd Wright; even if they had some\r\nexpectancy in their mind, they probably did not expected that Wright will give them the\r\nopportunity of being able live with the waterfall[^12]. Designers of built environment should 12\r\nhave their autonomy since they could decipher the multidimensional requirements of space\r\nand create a work that capable to embody the interdisciplinary values of architecture in\r\nsingularity. However, when a system became too autonomous it may be blinded to see the\r\nwhole or be tend to exclude features easily which are valuable to others. Thus, it is important\r\nto have control mechanisms to align and improve architectural work in order to be able to\r\nserve society and civilization. In that point participatory design process that Jon Lang argued\r\ncould foundate the healthy built environment; but conditions could only provided by\r\nunderstanding the meaning of architecture and convey it through society.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nMichel Foucault stunningly showed us[^13] even the most vicious practices of humanity was 13\r\narguably better than today in terms of providing leaks for progression. Although we are\r\nrationalized, technologically advanced and consider ourselves as civilized; it would not be\r\ntrue to say that we are progressed in every aspect. Dystopia differs from the dark times by its\r\ncompleteness in which there is no more opportunity to change. On the assumption, we do not\r\nsee and solve our problems in reality then even if we do not call it, we will start to live in the\r\nmodern dystopia.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the architecture of the 21. Century, it is crucial to point out, problems of\r\nbuilt environment caused by social paradoxes rather interdisciplinary or other aspects in our\r\nreality. Since the built environment is shaped directly by politics social infrastructure has to\r\nbe revealed for being able to diagnose this ill-shaped situation. Additionally, even if it is not\r\nthe actual part of design process, since they have to bear social responsibility, architects\r\nshould contribute as curators, educators, activists and critics in order to be able to shape our\r\nbuilt environment in more idealistic way and advance our civilization.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n[1] Berleant, Arnold & Carlson, Allen (Eds.)

I required to create this documents since I could not find both reliable syntactically coherent and citation guide.\r\n\r\n- Citation might fully grammatical syntactic but might take long time to write and looks ugly.\r\n- Citation might be elegant but consist of a lot of exceptions and problematic cases.\r\n- Some aspect considered, consistency, readability, extensibility and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nAim of this study to mix a set elegant and systatic citation setup that includes vast range of sources without question marks.\r\n\r\n- referenc entry\r\n- footnote\r\n- in-text reference\r\n\r\n## Types of Citation\r\nThree types of citation is held in this work these are\r\n- **In-text citation [WIP]**           : Most compact form of citation. Not favored due to preventation of readability. However it is convenient on some cases.\r\n- **Footnote/ Endnote citation [WIP]** : Often contains explanation or specific information (ex. page in book) \r\n- **Bibliography citation**      : Contains full information about to source\r\n\r\n## Semantics\r\n1. Citation gives minimum three of five **metadata information** about the source: \r\n    - **Who**: Who has created the work? \r\n    - **What**: What is the name of work?\r\n    - **Where**: If it is published where? \r\n    - **When**: When it is published or settled as frozen entity in history? \r\n    - **How**: How do we reach it? Access link / doi etc. \r\n    - The question why could be answered within the text or in footnotes but it is not a part of citation.\r\n    - ex. Who. _What_. Where. When. How\r\n2. One or information might be missing or not included. However, the order of the information is always the same and a citation should contain minimum 3 of the metadata information.\r\n    - ex. Author. _Book_. Publisher. Date.\r\n3. Each metadata information is separated and ended by . (dot) from each other except for **how**.\r\n    - ex. Author. _Book_. Publisher. Date.\r\n4. If the metadata is not conventional type: dissertation, book, article, newspaper. It should be indicated with square braces.\r\n    - ex. [Video], [Podcast]\r\n5. The source of the work is written italic. It might be a chapter of book, article in journal or a book itself.\r\n    - ex. Author. _A Book_ . ...\r\n    - ex. Author. \"Article\". In _Journal_. ...\r\n7. Part of something relationships indicated through quotation marks.\r\n    - ex. \"Concept\". In _Dictionary_.\r\n    - ex. \"Article\" In _Journal_.\r\n8. If the source name is in diffent language than article. The translation might be given in square braces after the name.\r\n    - ex. Artikel [Article].\r\n9. Page numbers are categorical exception handled as how. comes after date with : separation.\r\n\r\n**Example Book Citation:**  \r\n\r\nArendt, Hannah. _The Human Condition_.

Author, editor, producer etc.\r\n    - **Occasions**\r\n        - Single author\r\n            - **Desciption** In bibliography reference last name is written first separated by comma (,)\r\n            - **Formula** Last Name, First Name.\r\n            - **Example** Newton, Isaac.\r\n            - **Exception** If author has more than one names, only first name is written full rest is shortened by first letter.\r\n                - ex. Popper, Karl R.\r\n        - Two Author\r\n            - **Desciption** In bibliography reference last name is written first separated by comma (,) First name or names written shortened by dot (.) at the end.\r\n            - **Formula** Last Name 1, First Name First Letter 1. and Last Name 2, First Name First Letter 2.\r\n            - **Example** Acemoğlu, D. and Robinson, J. A.\r\n        - Three or more author\r\n            - **Desciption** Only first author name and constant abbreviation et al.

Mahremiyet seviyelerinin uzerine, doga etkilesimi, isik gibi gorunen parametrelerin yanisira, cogunlukla cozden kacip adlandirmadigimiz daha once varolmayan bir gercekligi yaratma, hayati daha keyifli ve anlamli kilmaya yarayacak yeni adimlari burada gormeye baslamistim. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"img60\"><img src=\"/nuxt_content/game_design/technical/mazeSolver_v1_animation.gif\"/></p>\r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Fig 2. Concept Art Ic Mekan </div>\r\n\r\n\r\nSonraki projelerde artik, ozelden kamu ve yari gecirgen yapilara gectigimizde. Ilk defa bir yorumlama ile tanistim. Proje konumuz geregi yaptigimiz oyuncak muzesinde Daniel Libeskind in yahudi muzesi bir arastirma konusu olarak onumuzde duruyordu. Bu bir sergileme mekani olarak sunulan muzeden oldukca farkli bir calismaydi. Hic bilgisi olamayan biri olarak baktigimda yapiyi itici ve rahatsiz edici olarak tanimlamistim. Fakat, bir soykirim muzesi olarak tasarlanan bu yapinin tam olarak da amaci buydu. Yapiyi gezen insanlar sadece tarihteki objeleri donuk olarak gorup bilgilenmeyecek, ayrica muzenin aktarmaya calistigi tarihi immersive olarak deneyimleyecekti. Fikrin basarili veya basarisiz olmasindan bagimsiz olarak \r\n\r\n- odtu sonrasi\r\n\r\nbasin tarafindan cok da goz onunde bulundurulamayan ancak yine de entellektuel bir karakter olarak saygi gormw sansina erismis tafuri gibi karakterle tanistim\r\n\r\n\r\ngorulmemisi yaratma\r\nfonksiyon duzenleme\r\n\r\n- insanlara baska, daha guzel bir hayatin mumkun oldugunu gosterme amacini tasir.\r\n\r\nihtiyaclara cevap verme beklwntileri karsilama\r\n\r\ngelisimi faktorlerini topluma gosterme ve yansitma\r\n\r\nMimarligin ne oldugu konusudnaki tanimi yeniden ve yeniden yapmam gerekiyordu. Bunca yillik egitimde ne oldugunu hala anlayadin mi diye sorabilirsiniz. Fakat mimarlik fakultesinde profesorler doktora ogrnecileri yapicilar tasarimcilar kuramcilar modelciler kime sorarsaniz farkli bir cevap alacaginiza eminim bir noktaya kadar bu normal ve beklenen bir durum. Cunku sosyoloji gibi soyutlanmamis bilim dallarinin problem alanlari cok genistir. Temel bilimlerdeki gibi kesin formulize edilmis ifadelerle konusmak mumkun degildir. Problemi bir denklem olarak dusunursek icine giten parametre sayisi o kadar farkli ve degiskendir ki butun etkilesimleri net bir kesilikte ifade etmek imkansizdie. bkz. chaos theoey. O yuzden ki bir baska kompleks bilim olan ekonomide ceteris paribus adinda sikca kullanilan bir deyim vardir. Diger buyun parametrelerin sabit kaldigi varsamiyla kisitli sayidaki degiskenin birbirine olan etkisini ifade etmek icin kullanilir.\r\n\r\nMimarligi da benzer sekilde cok kompleks bir bilim olarak duusnebilirsiniz. Yaptiginiz mimarlik sosyoloji ekonomi, matematik fizik, kultur hemen her seyi kapsayabilir. Bu denli karmasik bir yapiyi degerlendirmesi de bir o kadar zordur. Iyi mimari nedir, iyi mimar kimdir sorularinin cevaplarini aksiyomik bir kesinlikte cevaplamak mumkun degildir. Bu tamamen sizin tanimlari nasil yaptiginiz ve hangi girdileri hangi agirlikta degerli gordugunuzle ilgilidir.\r\n\r\nBu noktada bize iyi mimarlik olarak satilan mimari once neoliberal soylem araciligiyla toplum algisina islenir. Daha sonra sekillenen toplum algisinda populist soylemlerle yuceltilir.\r\n\r\nOte taraftan iyi mimarinin nasil olmasi gerektigindeki onermeler nedensellikle mesruiyet kazanabilir.\r\n\r\nSlogan problemi, bir onerme genis kapsamli bir seyi cok kisa sekilde ozetleyebilielr. Fakat slogan o kadar basittir ve o kadar genise hitap eder ki, cogunlukla ifade ettigi kavram uzerine cok dusunulmez veya anlamini yitirir veya cok boyutlulugunu yitirir.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<div class=\"hidden\">\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n# Links\r\n\r\n# Todo\r\n- gorseller\r\n    - modern\r\n        - le corbusier\r\n        - mies van der rohe\r\n    - starchitects\r\n        - zaha hadid\r\n        - gehry\r\n        - norman foster\r\n    - concept art\r\n        - gustine solomon cutoffs\r\n        - lotr cutoffs'\r\n        - skyrim solitude\r\n        - lotte brabender - tavern | https://www.artstation.com/artwork/eJDlED\r\n        - https://www.artstation.com/artwork/J9JgBv\r\n\r\n- my progression\r\n    - naive approach\r\n    - starchitects\r\n    - confrontation of concept art\r\n    - is not also an architecture\r\n    - how i developed project by project\r\n    - contribution of odtu\r\n    - criticism towarda built env\r\n\r\n- what is arch for\r\n    - Mimarlik sistem varolmauani gelistirme yebi bir yasam olasiligi onerme, yemekhane her yerde mutfak problem.\r\n    - Doganin gucunun tame edilmesi\r\n\r\n- problem of environment\r\n    - Tafuri mimar paranin ustune cikamiyor\r\n    - what is the problem with bim?\r\n    - asma tavani neden sevmiyorum\r\n    - Mimar denilen paraya hizemt eden bir tekniker konumuna dusuyoe\r\n    - Luks olmaktan ileri gidemeyecek pahali renderlar\r\n    - Isim fetisismine dusmus emek somurusu yapilan teknikerler\r\n    - mimari form bulma narsizmi uzerine\r\n    - mekanlarimiz bize, ozgurlesebilecegimiz mekanlar sunmuyor\r\n    - bize minimum ve kisitli alanlari sunuyor her sey discrete minimum\r\n\r\n- architectural education\r\n    - why production of arch and education wrong\r\n    - Arch critic dersi eski projeni al neyi sevmedigini bul\r\n    - Sonucta egitimi aldigi sey bosavcikiyor\r\n\r\n- mekanin kalitesini insan belirler\r\n- nereye ne yaptiniginizdan ziyade insanalr onemli\r\n- dolayisiyla insanlari egitir daha duyarli hale getirirseniz mekan ve ortsm guzellesir\r\n- fakst mekanin insanlari yonlendirme potansiyeli var dolayisiyla mekani bir ogretici olarka kullanabiliriz\r\n\r\n# Log\r\n- 04-Jan-2024 13.59-14.52       giris yazmaya basladim.

To win the game, good strategy with the factor of luck must be present together. The game can be played at different difficulty levels depending on the preference of the player group.\r\n\r\n__Disclaimer:__ The game draft is in the hypothetical phase. As it has not been tested, it may contain unforeseen logical problems or imbalanced cases.\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\nThe game space is created through combining hexagonal cards (module or dichotomy cards) to form a big hexagon form (map or board). Dichotomy cards are arranged randomly on the hexagonal game map. This condition introduces the factor of luck and creates an slightly different variation for each game. Map size is adjusted to include 13 module cards on the diagonal. Each session is aimed to last between 25-40 minutes to avoid the game becoming repetitive and overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Game Board](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/gameboard.png)\r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 1: Gameboard </div> \r\n\r\n\r\nEach player starts on a corner of the hexagonal map. Players' positions relative to each other are positioned so that they are uniformly distributed across the game board.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/player_placement.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 2: Player Placement </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n# Mechanics\r\nEach player starts the game with five basic stats. These are Health, Hunger, Stamina, Strength and Speed.  Dichotomy cards show the player's position on the map. Only one player can be on a card at a time. Rotating on clockwise, players move by choosing one of the cards adjacent to their current dichotomy card. Each dichotomy card gives one negative and one positive property, e.g. +1 speed, -1 hunger.  Players have stats that affected by dichotomy cards. \r\n\r\n\r\n| Icon            | Stat                    | Limit                         |Description                                                                      |\r\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| ![health](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/health.png)     | Heal      | 6 | Allows to player endure bad conditions if reaches zero, player dies.            |\r\n| ![hunger](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/hunger.png)     | Hunger    | 6 | Decreases one on each step if reaches zero player dies.                         |\r\n| ![strength](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/strength.png) | Strength  | 4 | Power of player to handle encounters.

As player moves on the dichotomy card, one applies the stat changes on their card by giving/taking color distincted stat cardridges. Player cannot fill more than maximum amount of the stat. Each player should explicitly show their stat cards to other players.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Player Sheet and Cartridges](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/player_sheet.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 4: Player Sheet and Stat Cartridges </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n__The game can be won in more in various ways__\r\n- By eliminating all the other players\r\n- Reaching the safe zone in the middle\r\n- By visiting 3 players starting place and acquiring their spawnstones.\r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Cards__ are step-over decisions that affects player stats. It contains minimum 3 basic information. These are: name of the card, positive aspect, and negative aspect.  \r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Card Levels__ There are three groups of dichotomy cards distinguished by color.  These groups are there to prevent players from moving around the map with uniform ease, and to create some alignment rules to prevent randomization from creating cul de sac situations that players lose at the early game. In other words, randomization is intended to introduce the factor of luck into the game, whereas alignment rules are there to prevent chance of being the dominant factor and overriding the player's decisions.\r\n\r\n| Color            | Level                    | Desciption                                                                      |\r\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Green            | Easy                     | Regular trade-off                                                               |\r\n| Yellow           | Medium                   | Unfair  trade-off                                                               |\r\n| Orange           | Hard                     | Extremely unfair trade-off                                                      |\r\n\r\n__Step over preventation__\r\nThe card the player steps on is flipped over and grayed out. This card loses its effect until the player exits the adjacent cards. At the end of each round the non-adjacent cards are reactivated. In order to win the game, the player needs to create a progressive strategy by balancing their stats on the maps and reading the actions of the other players.\r\n\r\n![Dichotomy Card](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/dichotomy_card.png)\r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 5: Dichotomy card (Back and Front) </div>\r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Card Examples__\r\n| Name             | Positive Aspect          | Negative Aspect                                                                 |\r\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Hunt             | +1 Hunger                | -1 Stamina                                                                      |\r\n| Stay             | +1 Energy                | -1 Hunger, No movement                                                          |\r\n| Training         | +1 Strength              | -1 Stamina, -1 Hunger                                                           |\r\n| Teleport         | -2 Energy, -1 Speed      | Move to desired location                                                        |\r\n| Portal           | -1 Energy, -1 Hunger     | Move to designated location (other portal)                                      |\r\n| ...              | ...                      | ...                                                                             |\r\n\r\n- Variations of dichotomy card is to be added considering the balance to extend the complexity of game.\r\n\r\n__Player versus Player__ Player could attack and kill other players. To hit another player, target player should be in the attack range by the player. Attacking another player costs 1 hunger and energy equal to players strength. If attacker players energy lesser than his/her strength, then player hit strength is regarded equivalent to as his/her stamina. Hit amount is decreased from attacked player's health. If it the health of attacked player reaches zero. Attacked player dies and attacker takes the position of attacked player, otherwise positions stays same.  \r\n\r\n# Modes and Variations\r\n- **Complexity Level 1:**\r\n    - There are certain single-use items added on the map with some rules. That enhances the stats extensively beyond limits, or provides unique abiltiy\r\n    - ex. bow, bicycle etc.\r\n\r\n- **Complexity Level 2:**\r\n    - Players have a technology tree and materials among map to create items in complexity level 2.\r\n    - ex. Research cooking, weapon craft\r\n\r\n- **Immortal mode:**\r\n    - the killed player reborns on starting zone. Loses his collected spawnstones\r\n\r\n# Story\r\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, there is scarce of sources to accommodate all. Survivalists compete against each other against each other to live.\r\n\r\n# Theory\r\nThe statement _decisions comes with trade-offs_ holds the subtle message of this game. One of the principles that I have adopted in the late stage of my life as I have learned through experience. I encounter often the falsification about the perception of the concept of decision. As it to be regarded something to gain but at the same time not to lose. A decision, choosing one of the two or more options. It opens up a new path, but it also means that other paths are closed. It might seem about a cruel reality. Yet it bear an austere elegance and beauty because decisions are the mere qualities of character that describes who we are. Accepting the responsibility of two-sided condition of a decision not only make us more mature but progress as a being. As a result, the game aimed to express the statement in an entertaining way.\r\n\r\n# References and Credits\r\n__Visual References__  \r\n1. All figures in the article produced by the author.\r\n2.

Players must replicate actions on real world in order to find some solutions to puzzles. The main idea of the game to establishing a ground to show that games has potential as an environment to be a platform of education. On the completition of the game player should be able to learn few origami pieces through the method of associative learning.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/chapters.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 1: Basic level origamis selected for each chapter </div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"hidden\">\r\n# Story\r\nOur player is an apprentice mage who has to train portals. His supervisor gives him extraordinary tasks to complete. In order to understand how interdimensionality works you should be able to accurately represent and simulate them in simple dimensions. Idea comes from quartenions. So he/she starts to learn to play with simple tasks. However, during one of his tasks something goes wrong and a portal opens to demonic world of caridia. Now our characters needs to focus on his training to overcome this problem.    \r\nStory | Draft | Hidden Test \r\nnot: burayi yeniden yaz story pek iyi degil.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Base Gameplay\r\nGameplay starts with a simple platformer game with moving around and exploring the world. With a simple mixed combat and puzzle feature for complex spells. Like a cookbook analogy in programming our character learns simple unitary modular folding techniques to create simple origami pieces, each of which associated with a power word, that could be used combine and casts spells ingame.  This techniques progresss further on a skill tree. It is aimed that the skill tree also resembles what player learned in real life as well. On each chapter player requires to create an origami piece. Writing a mark on number on each fold. At the end opening crafted origami piece on 2D reveals a map on how to solve a puzzle in game.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach power word is associated with a folding technique. Player uses keyboard shortcuts to cast power words. Spells are usually combination of (usually 3 or 4) few power words. In RPG combat player must cast spells. A complex set of power words represent portals as well as origami pieces.\r\n\r\nEach power word is learned through a simple puzzle. \r\n    \r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/skill_tree.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 2: Fold and Power Word Asssociation on Skill Tree <br> (hint: try dark mode) </div>\r\n\r\n# Mechanics\r\n\r\nBasic game mechanics is a adjusted combination of two main mechanics. Those are moderate paced, environmentally interactive top-down RPG game play and puzzle solving.\r\n\r\n__Spell Word Combinations__  \r\nEach spell is combination of one or more power words. During RPG combat, player uses the combination of power words through _button combos_ to cast spell to overcome challenges. This combinations further helps player to solve puzzles through replicating origami pieces in real life.  \r\nExample systems in real games (Ultima Online, Skyrim, Magicka).\r\n\r\n__Progressive Casting__  \r\nCasting a spell requires a small amount of time. Each cast process has three periods. Those are: _fizzle_, _success_, _excession_. With the analogy of cooking, _fizzle_ states represents a failing cast. If player ends casts too early, spell fizzles, simply fails without any effect. After the end of fizzle, _success_ period begins. During success, effect of spell increases exponantially until until excession period. The latest stage of the cast is _excession_ period. _Excession_ state is guaranteed failing cast and harms the player depending on the combination of spells. The harm is maximum at start and decreases parabolically up to half of maximum success effect.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/cast_graph.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 3: Spell Effect Change In Relation To Cast Periods </div>\r\n\r\nOn the combinations, different power words affect the cast time and proportions of the cast periods. Along with the mastery and usage frequency of the player.\r\nThrough the mix of spell word combination and progressive casting, it is aimed to create create precision input button combos, fun to play but hard to master base combat mechanics of the game. \r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/cast_bar.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 4: Periods of Cast Bar </div>\r\n\r\n__Real World Replication__  \r\nPlayer requires to solve a puzzle a to unlock, final chapter battles in game. A typical puzzle is again combination of power words, ingredients or keys to be used on certain sequence or places. This sequence is revealed through creating an origami piece through instructions explored in sub-chapters. On each fold player writes a power word on paper in real world. After completing and unfolding the origami piece, map for solving the puzzle is revealed. The sequence of instructions, and words are randomized to create unique map for each instance of the game.\r\n\r\n__Example Puzzle Chapter__\r\n- Game consist of chapters each chapters corresponds an origami piece, and chapters consists of sub-chapters each of one corresponds to fold-technique. \r\n- During sub-chapter with different hints player learns origami by retrieving knowledge such as which fold-technique to be used, how many times and where. Player could replicate this information step to create origami piece.\r\n- On certain steps, player are given some additional power words (as runes) for portal keys. On this case, the given rune needs to be written on  indicated area before applying the fold.\r\n- Completing the chapter, will result to complete the origami as well. However, to unlock next chapter, player requires to handle a boss fight. The boss fight room always resembles the unfolded paper of origami piece. On certain periods, boss stops and an area is indicated by color or light. On this time player should go to given area and cast the passing power word in given time.  \r\n- If player had replicated given fold techniques in real life, unfolding the origami should reveal the true power words, in that player could use true power word to cast the portal.\r\n- Upon completing successful RPG boss fight with the combination of origami puzzle player defeats the boss and gains access to the new chapter. Along with learning an origami in real life.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/mapping.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 5: Puzzle Solving Steps Depiction </div>\r\n\r\n__Puzzle Generation Steps__  \r\n1. Description selected origami for the chapter as a composition of folding steps.\r\n2. Decision on which steps to write a power rune on fold.\r\n3. Writing of appropriate questline for each fold and rune to reveal map.\r\n4. Design of boss fight mechanics and space that bears resemblance of unfolded origami.\r\n\r\n# Theory\r\n__Environmental Interactions__   \r\nAs a general principle, it is aimed to increase the interaction with the environment for player. Environment is not only frozen entity to move and orient for next encounter but also, something to be aware of and act depending of the requirements of the place. Player should be able to change, alter or impact on the environment. At the same time strategicaly use it for personal progression.  \r\nExample cases:  \r\n- Frost based spells has multipliers to hit greater to wet enemies.\r\n- Player should avoid using fire spells on environment with dry woods to create fire.\r\n- Player should position themselves tactically to avoid impact boulder rolls, and even use this phenomenon to encounter with enemies.\r\n\r\n__Integrated Mini Games__   \r\nOne of the problems that I have encountered in online games, that crafted objects costs lesser than material itself. Which is often wrong compared to the real world. The problem is gathering costs labor, however crafting does not, as a result since the material has variety of usage it worth more. To compete with this problem. It is aimed to set alternative progression mechanics such as crafting to be supported by engraved mini games to include and value them in labor. On further extreme, who whole complex game could be considered as a composition of mini games too.  \r\nExample cases:  \r\n- Progressive casting mechanism given above.\r\n- Lockpicking mechanism in Elder Scrolls series.\r\n- Hacking in Eve Online.\r\n\r\n__Internal Learning Mechanism__  \r\nThe mechanic requirements to solve puzzles or progression is aimed to be engraved in-game as much as possible. Player should not progress with grind with frozen state of mind, but immerse him/herself in the game content and try to solve a problem to make a progress.  \r\nExample casees:  \r\n- Trolls could be killed by using fire spells learned through a book (Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, 2011)\r\n- On crafting, player must adjust the necessary conditions to create best possible variations of weapon. This information could be retrieved from someone, or something from ingame. To avoid duplication of the solution outside of the game. Given sources are randomized every game. On example, to forge a good sword, player should set the temperature to correct level. The level is described as a color of something (for instance a peach) ingame by someone or some text. Player should get a peach to compare colors to see correct level adjustment. \r\n\r\n__Technology and Skill Trees__  \r\nAnother factor to establish an immersive environment is to push player to think and theorycraft the problem space created in-game. To create this environment, I consider, technology, and skill trees are good method to create complexity and considering people to think over variances and new possibilities to play and interract with the game. However, I belive skills trees should not shadow the players control over the character. Fundamental success should still be binded to player.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Sub Systems\r\n__Time and Date__  \r\nA time system tracks day/night cycles and calendar to set events. To bind sense of time to certain events such as puzzles or social/unique events ingame that enhances to create more surrounding environment in parallelity with the idea of Gesamkunstwerk.\r\n\r\n__Inventory__   \r\nAs a fundamental aspect of any role-playing game inventory system is aimed to include in Swapfold. To be able to progress on character, use of materials to create more powerful objects and increase environmental interaction.\r\n\r\n__Procedural Environment Generation__   \r\nDescribing environment as modules and computationally bind this parts to describe seamlessly transitive places. The idea is to create relatively unique experience on each seed, as well as preventing the rote progression. \r\n- Example games using described system: Diablo series, Valheim, Don't Starve\r\n\r\n__Controlled Randomization__\r\n- Map randomization: As a part of prodecural environment creation parts of the map is randomly customized\r\n- Puzzle randomization: To prevent same written guide to pass the game without playing it. The fold hints are given randomly to form a unique form for each puzzle instance.\r\n\r\n# References and Credits\r\n__Visual References__\r\n1. _Figure 1._ Basic level origamis selected for each chapter.

An overengineered mmorpg by Richard Garriott was able to create this dimension for me, with a further point that cinema could not reach in that time, the interaction. Cinema could make people cry, to experience something new but they are rarely include viewer as participant to their world (There are some discrete limited examples such as Black Mirror). In my experience, computer games and architecture are proven to be able to carry the potential of Gesamkunstwerk. They are capable to create, through an extended level of interaction, one could experinnce new world and beyond, one could interact with it though decisions and characteristic features. However due the required complexity of these works, we rarely encounter such games. As a result, I have always had the desire to pass on my experience to others as if I had seen a new color.

In other words, architecture changes society through subtle political statements through organizing, controlling, and defining the space. Foucault uses a blatant instance of the Panopticon to concrete his argument. Panopticon is a prison design produced as an idea experiment. The biggest problem of surveillance mechanisms is the numerical proportional difference between the actors. In other words, it is not possible to have a guard watch each prisoner, and it is not efficient either. Panopticon is a cylindrical prison, where in the middle, stands a watchtower for the guards, and prisoners in its perimeters. The overhead light prevents the prisoners from seeing the guards, while the guards are at any angle could observe each individual prisoners. Prisoners cannot know if they are being watched, as they cannot see the guards. Even if the guards are few in number, the prisoners have to act on the assumption that they are being watched. At the theoretical level, the problem is solved only with the spatial organization, namely architecture. Foucault has used it to express how architecture can shape human behavior through an extreme example like Panopticon. Although Foucault's example is negative and pessimistic, this potential is not only there to establish autocratic control, but to convey the causality phenomena that will make it possible to produce more free, just and sustainable environment for all. Indeed, as a more positive example, psychologist and educator Loris Malaguzzi referred to the place as the \"third teacher\" on the educational buildings, as it is referred to architecture could play a role to establish values such as equality, justice, freedom for all living beings and nature.

While the first three chapters contain my work on game design, in this chapter that I added later, I tried to list the reasons why I wanted to make a game. If you are not willing to read a relatively long essay, you can skip this section. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Game as Total Work of Art\r\nI have great affection for analyzing and creating things. Since the childhood I found myself in virtual dimensions of computer games as a vast field of exploration. I am amazed by how people combined designed systems and worlds using mathematics and art to resemble either life itself or non-existent world out of their imaginations.\r\n\r\nDuring my master education I have meet with various concepts and persons that contributed me a lot. One of these concepts were Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art. Concept coined by Richard Wagner to describe what he aimed to create rather than aesthetic experience, a new dimension that could surround the experiencing person and make them to feel something immersive and new. I was very excited by this concept because it clearly articulated the idea that imagination and artistic production could offer something more than an aesthetic experience that I was enthusiastic about.\r\n\r\nAlthough Wagner aimed to create this through the medium of opera, today many considers cinema as the new form of total work of art. Cinema is powerful enough for us to feel and experience completely new out of this world. I have no objection to the opinion that cinema. However when I first heard about the concept, first thing come to my mind was Ultima Online. An overengineered mmorpg by Richard Garriott was able to create this dimension for me, with a further point that cinema could not reach in that time, the interaction. Cinema could make people cry, to experience something new but they are rarely include viewer as participant to their world (There are some discrete limited examples such as Black Mirror). In my experience, computer games and architecture are proven to be able to carry the potential of Gesamkunstwerk. They are capable to create, through an extended level of interaction, one could experinnce new world and beyond, one could interact with it though decisions and characteristic features. However due the required complexity of these works, we rarely encounter such games. As a result, I have always had the desire to pass on my experience to others as if I had seen a new color. In order to show people that another life and a better world is possible, the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk offers the power to express this and computer games offer a method.\r\n\r\n## Platform for Experimentation\r\nSecondly, in 2016 I met with a youtube channel Primer by Justin Helps.  He is simulating famous theories through animation, statistics, and computer science. On the one hand, I think the way he presents his thought experiments with statistically based proofs, and on the other hand, the way he expresses it in a clear and very understandable way, and the way he presents it with effort and visualization, I think creates extraordinary works. What the Primer videos made me realize is that they provide an extraordinary platform for data generation, experimentation, and scientific inference in sociology, economic and public science in my analysis of online gaming experiences.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, online games of a certain size and complexity have economies that are like small-scale simulations of real life. By analyzing the ledgers in these economies and analyzing the data, we can clearly observe behavioral patterns that parallel those in the real world. Can people's behavior change from cooperative to cooperative in crisis situations (See Corrupted Blood Incident - World of Warcraft) How does human behavior change with inflation (Gold Pruning Events - Ultima Online/ World of Warcraft) Can we channel the time people spend having fun into producing functional scientific output (See Project Discovery - Eve online). Some of the conclusions that I find functional in life are that money is not a measure of value but a representation mechanism, and that labor is the real value. The system of risk and reward and the balance of supply and demand advocated by classical economics does not work linearly. To summerize, I think that game platforms can exist as potential and powerful platforms for scientific experimentation and production other than private beneficial purposes, but that this potential is rarely used, although there are examples. As a game designer, I think this potential should be assessed.\r\n\r\n## Platform for Education\r\nI hesitate to add the third aspect, because previous attempts with similar premises, such as television and youtube, have not worked out so well, but I will add it anyway because it is my peak goal. I think games as an educational platform can contribute to social development to form a better society and environment. \r\n\r\nIn nature, when we look at the concept of game, we see that it works as a simulation that gives the living being the abilities that prepare it for life. I think a similar template can be applied to counter the current notion of games as a market commodity where entertainment is sold. I think that games have the potential to be not only a means of transmitting functional knowledge, as in the case of survival in nature, but also educational platforms that offer causality to create a more just society, to become bettere over nature and sustainable environment. To extend this idea, I would like to example from architecture (another Gesamkunstwerk) through famous illustration of Panopticon by Michael Foucault. \r\n\r\nFoucault has seen architecture as inevitably political action. In other words, architecture changes society through subtle political statements through organizing, controlling, and defining the space. Foucault uses a blatant instance of the Panopticon to concrete his argument. Panopticon is a prison design produced as an idea experiment. The biggest problem of surveillance mechanisms is the numerical proportional difference between the actors. In other words, it is not possible to have a guard watch each prisoner, and it is not efficient either. Panopticon is a cylindrical prison, where in the middle, stands a watchtower for the guards, and prisoners in its perimeters. The overhead light prevents the prisoners from seeing the guards, while the guards are at any angle could observe each individual prisoners. Prisoners cannot know if they are being watched, as they cannot see the guards. Even if the guards are few in number, the prisoners have to act on the assumption that they are being watched. At the theoretical level, the problem is solved only with the spatial organization, namely architecture. Foucault has used it to express how architecture can shape human behavior through an extreme example like Panopticon. Although Foucault's example is negative and pessimistic, this potential is not only there to establish autocratic control, but to convey the causality phenomena that will make it possible to produce more free, just and sustainable environment for all. Indeed, as a more positive example, psychologist and educator Loris Malaguzzi referred to the place as the \"third teacher\" on the educational buildings, as it is referred to architecture could play a role to establish values such as equality, justice, freedom for all living beings and nature. <sup>1</sup>\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I think I have experimented with the idea that games can be educational platforms. To exemplify at the individual level, I got my thoughts on economics and sociology from my abstracted simulation experiences in games. I have seen how people act in crisis situations. Games taught me the difference between fact and image, and awareness of the ideas such as rhetoric over logic <sup>2</sup>, on social experiences. I learned the second language English through games, and the idea of the dichotomous relationship between chaos and order <sup>3</sup>, which later contributed to my master thesis in architecture. Regardless of the right or wrong of my thoughts, I think that games had a great impact on the formation of my intellectual identity.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I believe that games have the potential to be a complete work of art, a platform for experimentation, as well as a platform for education and social development, but this potentials are rare except some subtle extraordinary cases. Just like the value that I have gained from games, I think that by creating works with this potential, I can add new dimensions to the perception of the game and create works that could add value to humanity that has not only have artistic and scientific value but also something that could allows us to create a better, self-sustainable, and fair society.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of my game design portfolio.   \r\nThank you for your time and attention. :)\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n1.

To win the game, good strategy with the factor of luck must be present together. The game can be played at different difficulty levels depending on the preference of the player group.\r\n\r\n__Disclaimer:__ The game draft is in the hypothetical phase. As it has not been tested, it may contain unforeseen logical problems or imbalanced cases.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\nThe game space is created through combining hexagonal cards (module or dichotomy cards) to form a big hexagon form (map or board). Dichotomy cards are arranged randomly on the hexagonal game map. This condition introduces the factor of luck and creates an slightly different variation for each game. Map size is adjusted to include 13 module cards on the diagonal. Each session is aimed to last between 25-40 minutes to avoid the game becoming repetitive and overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Game Board](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/gameboard.png)\r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 1: Gameboard </div> \r\n\r\n\r\nEach player starts on a corner of the hexagonal map. Players' positions relative to each other are positioned so that they are uniformly distributed across the game board.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/player_placement.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 2: Player Placement </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mechanics\r\nEach player starts the game with five basic stats. These are Health, Hunger, Stamina, Strength and Speed.  Dichotomy cards show the player's position on the map. Only one player can be on a card at a time. Rotating on clockwise, players move by choosing one of the cards adjacent to their current dichotomy card. Each dichotomy card gives one negative and one positive property, e.g. +1 speed, -1 hunger.  Players have stats that affected by dichotomy cards. \r\n\r\n\r\n| Icon            | Stat                    | Limit                         |Description                                                                      |\r\n|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| ![health](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/health.png)     | Heal      | 6 | Allows to player endure bad conditions if reaches zero, player dies.            |\r\n| ![hunger](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/hunger.png)     | Hunger    | 6 | Decreases one on each step if reaches zero player dies.                         |\r\n| ![strength](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/icons/strength.png) | Strength  | 4 | Power of player to handle encounters.

As player moves on the dichotomy card, one applies the stat changes on their card by giving/taking color distincted stat cardridges. Player cannot fill more than maximum amount of the stat. Each player should explicitly show their stat cards to other players.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Player Sheet and Cartridges](/nuxt_content/dichotomies/player_sheet.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 4: Player Sheet and Stat Cartridges </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n__The game can be won in more in various ways__\r\n- By eliminating all the other players\r\n- Reaching the safe zone in the middle\r\n- By visiting 3 players starting place and acquiring their spawnstones.\r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Cards__ are step-over decisions that affects player stats. It contains minimum 3 basic information. These are: name of the card, positive aspect, and negative aspect.  \r\n\r\n__Dichotomy Card Levels__ There are three groups of dichotomy cards distinguished by color.  These groups are there to prevent players from moving around the map with uniform ease, and to create some alignment rules to prevent randomization from creating cul de sac situations that players lose at the early game. In other words, randomization is intended to introduce the factor of luck into the game, whereas alignment rules are there to prevent chance rom being the dominant factor and overriding the player's preferences.\r\n\r\n| Color            | Level                    | Desciption                                                                      |\r\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Green            | Easy                     | Regular trade-off                                                               |\r\n| Yellow           | Medium                   | Unfair  trade-off                                                               |\r\n| Orange           | Hard                     | Extremely unfair trade-off                                                      |\r\n\r\n__Step over preventation__\r\nThe card the player steps on is flipped over and grayed out. This card loses its effect until the player exits the adjacent cards. At the end of each round the non-adjacent cards are reactivated.

To hit another player, target player should be in the attack range by the player. Attacking another player costs 1 hunger and energy equal to players strength. If attacker players energy lesser than his/her strength, then player hit strength is regarded equivalent to as his/her stamina. Hit amount is decreased from attacked player's health. If it the health of attacked player reaches zero. Attacked player dies and attacker takes the position of attacked player, otherwise positions stays same.  \r\n\r\n### Modes and Variations\r\n- **Complexity Level 1:**\r\n    - There are certain single-use items added on the map with some rules. That enhances the stats extensively beyond limits, or provides unique abiltiy\r\n    - ex. bow, bicycle etc.\r\n\r\n- **Complexity Level 2:**\r\n    - Players have a technology tree and materials among map to create items in complexity level 2.\r\n    - ex. Research cooking, weapon craft\r\n\r\n- **Immortal mode:**\r\n    - the killed player reborns on starting zone. Loses his collected spawnstones\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, there is scarce of sources to accommodate all.

One of the principles that I have adopted in the late stage of my life as I have learned through experience. I encounter often the falsification about the perception of the concept of decision. As it to be regarded something to gain but at the same time not to lose. A decision, choosing one of the two or more options. It opens up a new path, but it also means that other paths are closed.

Players must replicate actions on real world in order to find some solutions to puzzles. The main idea of the game to establishing a ground to show that games has potential as an environment to be a platform of education. On the completition of the game player should be able to learn few origami pieces through the method of associative learning.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/chapters.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 1: Basic level origamis selected for each chapter </div>\r\n\r\n### | Story\r\nOur player is an apprentice mage who has to train portals. His supervisor gives him extraordinary tasks to complete. In order to understand how interdimensionality works you should be able to accurately represent and simulate them in simple dimensions. Idea comes from quartenions. So he/she starts to learn to play with simple tasks. However, during one of his tasks something goes wrong and a portal opens to demonic world of caridia. Now our characters needs to focus on his training to overcome this problem.\r\n\r\n### | Base Gameplay\r\nGameplay starts with a simple platformer game with moving around and exploring the world. With a simple mixed combat and puzzle feature for complex spells. Like a cookbook analogy in programming our character learns simple unitary modular folding techniques to create simple origami pieces, each of which associated with a power word, that could be used combine and casts spells ingame (ultima online / magicka / skyrim).  This techniques progresss further on a skill tree. It is aimed that the skill tree also resembles what player learned in real life as well. On eah chapter player requires to create an origami piece. Writing a mark on number on each fold. At the end opening crafted orgami piece on 2D reveals a map on how to solve a puzzle in game.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach power word is associated with a folding technique. Player uses keyboard shortcuts to cast power words. Spells are usually combination of (usually 3 or 4) few power words. In rpg combat player must cast spells. A complex set of power words represent portals as well as origami pieces.\r\n\r\nEach power word is learned through a simple puzzle. \r\n    \r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/skill_tree.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 2: Fold and Power Word Asssociation on Skill Tree </div>\r\n\r\n### | Mechanics\r\n\r\nBasic game mechanics is a adjusted combination of two main mechanics. Those are moderate paced, environmentally interactive topdown rpg game play and puzzle solving.\r\n\r\n__Spell Word Combinations__  \r\nEach spell is combination of one or more power words. During rpg combat, player uses the combination of power words through _button combos_ to cast spell to overcome challenges. This combinations further helps player to solve puzzles through replicating origami pieces in real life.  \r\nExample systems in real games (ultima online, skyrim, magicka)\r\n\r\n__Progressive Casting__  \r\nCasting a spell requires a small amount of time. Each cast process has three periods. Those are: _fizzle_, _success_, _excession_. With the analogy of cooking, _fizzle_ states represents a failing cast. If player ends casts too early, spell fizzles, simply fails without any effect. After the end of fizzle, _success_ period begins. During success, effect of spell increases exponantially until until excession period. The latest stage of the cast is _excession_ period. _Excession_ state is guaranteed failing cast and harms the player depending on the combination of spells. The harm is maximum at start and decreases parabolically up to half of maximum success effect.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/cast_graph.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 3: Spell Effect Change In Relation To Cast Periods </div>\r\n\r\nOn the combinations, different power words affect the cast time and proportions of the cast periods. Along with the mastery and usage frequency of the player.\r\nThrough the mix of spell word combination and progressive casting, it is aimed to create create precision input button combos, fun to play but hard to master base combat mechanics of the game. \r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/cast_bar.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 4: Periods of Cast Bar </div>\r\n\r\n__Real World Replication__  \r\nPlayer requires to solve a puzzle a to unlock, final chapter battles in game. A typical puzzle is again combination of power words, ingredients or keys to be used on certain sequence or places. This sequence is revealed through creating an origami piece through instructions explored in sub-chapters. On each fold player writes a power word on paper in real world. After completing and unfolding the origami piece, map for solving the puzzle is revealed. The sequence of instructions, and words are randomized to create unique map for each instance of the game.\r\n\r\n__Example Puzzle Chapter__\r\n- Game consist of chapters each chapters corresponds an origami piece, and chapters consists of sub-chapters each of one corresponds to fold-technique. \r\n- During sub-chapter with different hints player learns origami by retrieves knowledge such as which fold-technique to be used, how many times and where. Player could replicate this information step to create origami piece.\r\n- On certain steps, player are given some additional power words (as runes) for portal keys. On this case, the given rune needs to be written on  indicated area before applying the fold.\r\n- Completing the chapter, will result to complete the origami as well. However, to unlock next chapter, player requires to handle a boss fight. The boss fight room always resembles the unfolded paper of origami piece. On certain periods, boss stops and an area is indicated by color or light. On this time player should go to given area and cast the true power word.  \r\n- If player had replicated given fold techniques in real life, unfolding the origami should reveal the true power words, in that player could use true power word to cast the portal.\r\n- Upon completing successful rpg boss fight with the combination of origami puzzle player defeats the boss and gains access to the new chapter. Along with learning an origami in real life.\r\n\r\n![Player Placement](/nuxt_content/swapfold/mapping.png)  \r\n<div class=\"caption\"> Figure 5: Puzzle Solving Steps Depiction </div>\r\n\r\n__Puzzle Generation Steps__  \r\n1. Description selected origami for the chapter as a composition of folding steps.\r\n2. Decision on which steps to write a power rune on fold.\r\n3. Writing of appropriate questline for each fold and rune to reveal map.\r\n4. Design of boss fight mechanics and space that bears resemblance of unfolded origami.\r\n\r\n### | Theory\r\n__Environmental Interactions__   \r\nAs a general principle, it is aimed to increase the interaction with the environment for player. Environment is not only frozen entity to move and orient for next encounter but also, something to be aware of and act depending of the requirements of the place. Player should be able to change, alter or impact on the environment. At the same time strategicaly use it for personal progression.  \r\nExample cases:  \r\n- Frost based spells has multipliers to hit greater to wet enemies.\r\n- Player should avoid using fire spells on environment with dry woods to create fire.\r\n- Player should position themselves tactically to avoid impact boulder rolls, and even use this phenomenon to encounter with enemies.\r\n\r\n__Integrated Mini Games__   \r\nOne of the problems that I have encountered in online games, that crafted objects costs lesser than material itself. Which is often wrong compared to the real world. The problem is gathering costs labor, however crafting does not, as a result since the material has variety of usage it worth more. To compete with this problem. It is aimed to set alternative progression mechanics such as crafting to be supported by engraved mini games to include and value them in labor. On further extreme, who whole complex game could be considered as a composition of mini games too.  \r\nExample cases:  \r\n- Progressive casting mechanism given above.\r\n- Lockpicking mechanism in Elder Scrolls series.\r\n- Hacking in Eve Online.\r\n\r\n__Internal Learning Mechanism__  \r\nThe mechanic requirements to solve puzzles or progression is aimed to be engraved in-game as much as possible. Player should not progress with grind with frozen state of mind, but immerse him/herself in the game content and try to solve a problem to make a progress.  \r\nExample casees:  \r\n- Trolls could be killed by using fire spells learned through a book (Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, 2011)\r\n- On crafting, player must adjust the necessary conditions to create best possible variations of weapon. This information could be retrieved from someone, or something from ingame. To avoid duplication of the solution outside of the game. Given sources are randomized every game. On example, to forge a good sword, player should set the temperature to correct level. The level is described as a color of something (for instance a peach) ingame by someone or some text. Player should get a peach to compare colors to see correct level adjustment. \r\n\r\n__Technology and Skill Trees__  \r\nAnother factor to establish an immersive environment is to push player to think and theorycraft the problem space created in-game. To create this environment, I consider, technology, and skill trees are good method to create complexity and considering people to think over variances and new possibilities to play and interract with the game. However, I belive skills trees should not shadow the players control over the character. Fundamental success should still be binded to player.\r\n\r\n__Environmental Interactions__  \r\n\r\n\r\n### | Sub Systems\r\n__Time and Date__  \r\nA time system tracks day/night cycles and calendar to set events. To bind sense of time to certain events such as puzzles or social/unique events ingame that enhances to create more surrounding environment in parallelity with the idea of Gesamkunstwerk.\r\n\r\n__Inventory__   \r\nAs a fundamental aspect of any role-playing game inventory system is aimed to include in Swapfold. To be able to progress on character, use of materials to create more powerful objects and increase environmental interaction.\r\n\r\n__Procedural Environment Generation__   \r\nDescribing environment as modules and computationally bind this parts to describe seamlessly transitive places. The idea is to create relatively unique experience on each seed, as well as preventing the rote progression. \r\n- Example games using described system: Diablo series, Valheim, Don't Starve\r\n\r\n__Controlled Randomization__\r\n- Map randomization: As a part of prodecural environment creation parts of the map is randomly customized\r\n- Puzzle randomization: To prevent same written guide to pass the game without playing it. The fold hints are given randomly to form a unique form for each puzzle instance.\r\n\r\n### | References\r\n__Visual References__\r\n1. _Figure 1._ Basic level origamis selected for each chapter.

Nebensatz\r\nWord order and subordinate clauses:\r\n\r\nGerman language has a strict positioning rule about the verbs. Those are:\r\n\r\n- **Hauptsatz:** (main clauses) Sentences that stands alone as a whole. The verb stand always in second position.\r\n    - A single sentence may contain two or more verbs. The positioning may vary dependent on case, however in most situations like **modals verbs** auxiliary verb comes to <i class=\"pos2\">second position</i> while main verb goes to <i class=\"pos-1\">the end of the sentence.</i>\r\n        - ex. **Modalverb:** Ich <i class=\"pos2\">kann</i> mir <i class=\"pos-1\">vorstellen</i>.\r\n        - ex. **Perfekt:** Ich <i class=\"pos2\">habe</i> gestern <i class=\"pos-1\">gearbeitet</i>.\r\n    - **Attention:** Second position does not mean second word. First position might belong to a clause.\r\n        - ex. <i class=\"pos1\">Deutsche Grammatikbücher</i> <i class=\"pos2\">sind</i> sehr teuer.\r\n    - **Haupsatz Konnektoren:** There are three basic connectors in German language to bind Hauptsatz. Those are, **und (and)**, **oder (or)**, and **aber (or)**. Those connectors. In Grammatical sense, these connectors refers to a new sentence beginnings. Could be regarded as dot.\r\n        - ex. Ich <i class=\"pos2\">gehe</i> ins Kino, <i class=\"kon\">und</i> meine Freunde <i class=\"pos2\">kommen</i> mit.\r\n        - ex. Entweder <i class=\"pos2\">gehen</i> wir ins Kino, <i class=\"kon\">oder</i> wir <i class=\"pos2\">bleiben</i> zu Hause.\r\n        - ex. Ich <i class=\"pos2\">möchte</i> ins Kino <i class=\"pos-1\">gehen</i>, <i class=\"kon\">aber</i> ich <i class=\"pos2\">habe</i> kein Geld.\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Nebensatz:** (subordinate clauses) Usually gives additional information about the main sentence. Could indicate reason, result etc. Subordinate clauses are there to create more complex sentences. And binded the main sentence with a specific <i class=\"kon\">connector</i> Could be skipped for now. Yet there it might be helpful to see an example.\r\n    - ex. Ich <i class=\"pos2\">trinke</i> Tee, <i class=\"hl\"><i class=\"kon\">weil</i> ich Halsschmerzen <i class=\"pos-1\">habe</i></i>.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Modalverben\r\nIn German, modal verbs are a type of auxiliary verb that express modalities such as ability, possibility, permission, necessity, and obligation. \r\nThere are 6 modal verbs in German. Those are:\r\n\r\n| Modalverb   | Trans                           | Example        |  \r\n| :---------  | :----------                     | :--            | \r\n| **können**  | to be able to / can             | ich <i class=\"pos2\">kann</i> <i class=\"pos-1\">schwimmen</i>.\r\n| **müssen**  | must / have to                  | er <i class=\"pos2\">muss</i> seine Aufgaben <i class=\"pos-1\">erledigen</i>. \r\n| **sollen**  | should / should be supposed to  | wir <i class=\"pos2\">sollten</i> nach Reykjavik <i class=\"pos-1\">gehen</i>.\r\n| **dürfen**  | may / be allowed to             | Sie <i class=\"pos2\">dürfen</i> hier nicht <i class=\"pos-1\">rauchen</i>.\r\n| **wollen**  | want to                         | Ihr <i class=\"pos2\">wolltet</i> zu uns <i class=\"pos-1\">kommen</i>.\r\n| **möchten** | would like to                   | Sie <i class=\"pos2\">will</i> Tennis <i class=\"pos-1\">spielen</i>.\r\n\r\nIn order to use modalverbs correctly in Grammar. One needs to be aware of couple of things.\r\n1. Verb position structure: In most basic German sentence\r\n2. Declination of the modal verb according to subject.\r\n\r\n## Kasus II: Akkusativ und Dativ\r\n\r\n# Accusative case  \r\n\r\n**What is case**  \r\nCase refers to the grammatical category of a noun, pronoun, or adjective that reflects its syntactic and semantic role in a sentence. \r\n\r\nThere are four cases in German grammar. Table below is to represent rough functions of these cases in the sentence and all of them color coded. While the nominative case is part of former chapters. In here, akkusativ and dativ cases will be focused.\r\n\r\n| Case                         | Function              | Examle       |\r\n|:--                           |:--                    |:--           |\r\n| <i class=\"nom\">Nominativ</i> | Subject of verb       | <i class=\"nom\">Ich</i> gebe.\r\n| <i class=\"akk\">Akkusativ</i> | Direct object         | <i class=\"nom\">Ich</i> gebe <i class=\"akk\">das Grammatikbuch</i>.\r\n| <i class=\"dat\">Dativ</i>     | Indirect object       | <i class=\"nom\">Ich</i> gebe <i class=\"dat\">meinem Vater</i> <i class=\"akk\">das Grammatikbuch</i>.\r\n| <i class=\"gen\">Genitiv</i>   | Possession indicative | <i class=\"nom\">Ich</i> gebe <i class=\"dat\">meinem Vater</i> <i class=\"akk\">das Grammatikbuch</i> <i class=\"gen\">der deutschen Sprache</i>. \r\n\r\n**How to identify accusative case?**  \r\nThere are four situations to identify accusative object in German.\r\n\r\n1. Direct object: In most basic example, accusative case refers to the direct object in sentence. Or in other words what is being \"verbed\".\r\n|             |                                                                         |\r\n| :---------: | :---------------------:                                                 |\r\n| **Example**    | Ich gebe <i class=\"akk\">das Buch</i>.        \r\n| **Explanation** |  In this example verb is \"gebe\" give what is given: the book <br> This condition could be identified by the questions in the sentence **what?**\r\n\r\n2. Accusative prepositions: Some prepositions in German always require accusative case. Those prepositions are: _durch_, _für_, _gegen_, _ohne_, _um_ and _entlang_.\r\n|                 |                                                                         |\r\n| :---------:     | :---------------------:                                                 |\r\n| **Example**     | Ich fahre *gegen* <i class=\"akk\"> die Wand</i>.\r\n| **Translation** | I drive against the wall.       \r\n| **Explanation** | The direct object in the accusative case, governed by the preposition \"gegen.\"\r\n\r\n3. Accusative personal pronouns: There are accusative version of pronouns that indicates the case in sentence. Those needs to be learned by heart.\r\n\r\n|<i class=\"nom\"> Nominativ </i> | <i class=\"akk\">Akkusativ</i>  | <i class=\"dat\">Dativ</i>\r\n| :--      | :--        | :-- |\r\n| ich      | mich       | mir\r\n| du       | dich       | dir\r\n| er       | ihn        | ihm\r\n| sie      | sie        | ihr\r\n| es       | es         | ihm\r\n| wir      | uns        | uns\r\n| ihr      | euch       | euch\r\n| sie      | sie        | ihnen\r\n| Sie      | Sie        | Ihnen\r\n\r\n|                 |                                                                         |\r\n| :---------:     | :---------------------:                                                 |\r\n| **Example**     | Er sieht <i class=\"akk\"> mich</i>.\r\n| **Translation**     | He sees me.\r\n| **Explanation** | Mich is personal pronoun accusative version of nominative ich.\r\n\r\n4. Indefinite pronouns: Indefinite pronouns like someone (jemand) or something (etwas) are always in accusative case.\r\n|                 |                                                                         |\r\n| :---------:     | :---------------------:                                                 |\r\n| **Example**     | Ich suche <i class=\"akk\"> etwas</i>.\r\n| **Translation** | I am looking for something.\r\n| **Explanation** | Something is indefinite pronoun always in accusative.\r\n\r\n**Grammatical changes of accusative case**   \r\nAccusative object in German sentences changes the definite or indefinite article of the object. The only difference between nominativ and accusative case occurs on masculine articles.\r\n\r\n|                               | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Plural |\r\n| :--                           | :--       | :--           | :--              | :--           |\r\n| <i class=\"nom\">Nominativ</i> | der        | die           | das              | die           |\r\n| <i class=\"akk\">Akkusativ</i> | den        | die           | das              | die           |\r\n\r\n# Dativ Case\r\n\r\nDative case in german refers to indirect object in sentence. The dative object is something affected by the action occured in sentence. It could be the noun that receives something in accusative case. The question to be asked to sentence to dative case is \"Was?(what)\".\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to identify dative case?**    \r\n\r\n1. Indirect object: The Dative case is used for the indirect object of a sentence. To determine the indirect object, ask \"to/for whom\" or \"to/for what\" the verb is acting upon. The indirect object usually comes before the direct object in the sentence.\r\n\r\n|             |                                                                         |\r\n| :---------: | :---------------------:                                                 |\r\n| **Example**    | Ich gebe <i class=\"dat\">meinem Vater</i> <i class=\"akk\">das Buch</i>.        \r\n| **Explanation** |  In this example the object book is given to who? <br> This condition could be identified by the questions in the sentence **whom?**\r\n\r\n2. Dative prepositions: Some prepositions always require the Dative case. These include \"aus\" (out of), \"bei\" (at), \"mit\" (with), \"nach\" (after), \"seit\" (since), \"von\" (from), \"zu\" (to), and \"gegenüber\" (opposite).\r\n\r\n|             |                                                                         |\r\n| :---------: | :---------------------:                                                 |\r\n| **Example**    | Ich gehe *mit* <i class=\"dat\">meinem Freund</i> ins Kino.        \r\n| **Explanation** |  \"Meinem Freund\" is the indirect object in the dative case, governed by the preposition \"mit\".\r\n\r\n3. Indirect object pronouns: Pronouns that represent the indirect object in a sentence are in the Dative case. \r\n|<i class=\"nom\"> Nominativ </i> | <i class=\"akk\">Akkusativ</i>  | <i class=\"dat\">Dativ</i>\r\n| :--      | :--        | :-- |\r\n| ich      | mich       | mir\r\n| du       | dich       | dir\r\n| er       | ihn        | ihm\r\n| sie      | sie        | ihr\r\n| es       | es         | ihm\r\n| wir      | uns        | uns\r\n| ihr      | euch       | euch\r\n| sie      | sie        | ihnen\r\n| Sie      | Sie        | Ihnen\r\n\r\n|             |                                                                         |\r\n| :---------: | :---------------------:                                                 |\r\n| **Example**    | Sie schickt <i class=\"dat\">mir</i> eine E-Mail.        \r\n| **Explanation** | \"Mir\" ist dative form of \"ich\" and represents indirect object in the sentence. \r\n\r\n**Grammatical changes of dative case**   \r\nDative object in German sentences changes the definite or indefinite article of the object. \r\n\r\n|                              | Masculine                | Feminine               | Neuter                 | Plural                 |\r\n| :--                          | :--                      | :--                    | :--                    | :--                    |\r\n| <i class=\"nom\">Nominativ</i> | der                      | die                    | das                    | die                    |\r\n| <i class=\"akk\">Akkusativ</i> | de<i class=\"akk\">n</i>   | die                    | das                    | die                    |\r\n| <i class=\"dat\">Dativ</i>     | de<i class=\"dat\">m </i>  | d<i class=\"dat\">er</i> | d<i class=\"dat\">em</i> | de<i class=\"dat\">n</i> |\r\n\r\n<div class=\"hidden\">\r\n**Differences**  \r\ntodo: mir ist kalt\r\ntodo: prepositions gorseli, akk ve dativ\r\ntodo: whom? question is both akkusative and dative\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n  ----------------  \r\n /.               \\  \r\n/ .                \\  \r\n--------------------\r\n| .                | \r\n| .                | \r\n| .                | \r\n| .                | \r\n| .

There are many local prepositions. The most common are:\r\n\r\nSome of the prepositions could be either dativ or akkusativ while some are found only on one case. For the prepositions that could both take akkusativ and dativ case, the case is determined through asking questions **wo? wohin? or woher?** \r\n\r\n- Wo? und Woher? is dativ case.\r\n- Wohin? is akkusativ case.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Präp           | Description  | Example                                           | Case     | \r\n| :--            | :--          | :--                                               | :--      |\r\n| an             | near, next   | Das Bild hängt an der Wand.                       | A/D\r\n| auf            | on           | Das buch liegt auf dem Tisch.                     | A/D\r\n| hinter         | behind       | Ich gehe hinter dem Auto.                         | A/D\r\n| in             | in           | Ich bin in der Schule.                            | A/D\r\n| neben          | next         | Das Café liegt neben dem Park.                    | A/D\r\n| über           | above, over  | Das Flugzeug fliegt über den Wolken.              | A/D\r\n| unter          | under        | Die Katze liegt unter dem Tisch.                  | A/D\r\n| vor            | Front        | Ich stehe vor dem Haus.                           | A/D\r\n| zwischen       | in between   | Der Fluss fließt zwischen den beiden Bergen.      | A/D\r\n| aus            | from         | ich komme aus der Türkei.                         | D\r\n| zu             | to           | Ich gehe zu meinem Freund nach Hause.             | D\r\n| von .. nach .. | from.. to..  | Ich reise von Berlin nach München mit dem Zug.    | D\r\n| gegenüber      | opposite     | Das Restaurant ist gegenüber dem Bahnhof.         | D    \r\n| um/herum       | around       | Wir sund um die Welt gereist.                     | A\r\n| durch          | through      | Ich gehe jeden Tag durch den Park.                | A\r\n| gegen          | against      | Die Mannschaft spielt gegen die beste Mannschaft. | A","dir":"/blog/documentation/deutsch","path":"/blog/documentation/deutsch/Deutsch_A2.1","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-11-24T15:14:51.000Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-23T16:46:30.703Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1715292462471},"$loki":36},{"slug":"Deutsch_A2.2","description":null,"template":1.2,"isVisible":true,"title":"Deutsch A2.2","date":"2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","version":1,"language":"de","type":"log","tags":"notes; language; course;","img":null,"toc":[{"id":"zeitform-ii-perfekt","depth":2,"text":"Zeitform II: Perfekt"},{"id":"adjektivdeklination","depth":2,"text":"Adjektivdeklination"},{"id":"artikelgebrauch","depth":2,"text":"Artikelgebrauch"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"zeitform-ii-perfekt"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#zeitform-ii-perfekt","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Zeitform II: Perfekt"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One of the fundamental aspects language is speaking about the past."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The most basic grammatik time form (das Tempus) of past (die Vergangenheit) is "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Perfekt"}]},{"type":"text","value":".

In order to be able to create sentences in Perfekt. One needs to have various basic knowledge.\r\n\r\n1. **Understanding of verb positioning** in German sentences. Since perfekt requires two verbs in one sentence.\r\n2. **Partizip II** A special type of verb conjugation that is used in perfect and passiv sentences.\r\n\r\n| Examples            | Präsens                      | Perfekt      |\r\n| :--                 | :--                          | :--          |\r\n| **sein regular**    | Ich <i class=\"pos2\">fahre</i> nach Berlin.       | Ich <i class=\"pos2\">bin</i> nach Berlin <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gefahren</i>.\r\n| **sein irregular**  | Ich <i class=\"pos2\">gehe</i> nach Hause.         | Ich <i class=\"pos2\">bin</i> nach Hause <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gegangen</i>.\r\n| **haben regular**   | Ich <i class=\"pos2\">lese</i> das Buch.           | Ich <i class=\"pos2\">habe</i> das Buch <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gelesen</i>.\r\n| **haben irregular** | Ich <i class=\"pos2\">esse</i> zu viel.            | Ich <i class=\"pos2\">habe</i> zu viel <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gegessen</i>.\r\n\r\nPerfect sentences in German language uses passing conjugation of auxiliary verb (sein or haben). Which form is going to be used is dependent on the verb. 90% of the words uses \"haben\" while relocation indicating verbs such as gehen, fahren, laufen uses \"sein\". There are also some exceptions.\r\n\r\nSecond part is the Partizip II version of the main verb. In Partizip II there are regular and irregular versions. Often needs to be learned by heart.\r\n\r\n**Conjugating Partizip II**  \r\nPartizip II is also known as the past partipciple formed by adding  prefix \"ge-\", and suffix \"-t\" or \"-et\" to the verb stem. It used in various ways.\r\n\r\n| Infinitiv | Stamm | Partizip II | Regular?|\r\n| :--       | :--   | :--         | :--     |\r\n| machen    | mach      | **ge**mach**t**   | ja      \r\n| spielen   | spiel     | **ge**spiel**t**  | ja\r\n| lernen    | lern      | **ge**lern**t**   | ja      \r\n| sein      | sei       | gewesen           | nein\r\n| haben     | hab       | gehabt            | nein      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- **To form the Perfekt tense**\r\n    - ex. <i class=\"hl\">Gestern habe ich eine E-Mail **geschrieben.**</i>\r\n- To form the passive voice\r\n    - Das Haus wurde **gebaut.**\r\n- A an adjective\r\n    - ex. Ein **gekochtes** Ei\r\n\r\n# Beispiele im Perfekt\r\n1. Ich lerne Deutsch\r\n    - Ich habe Deutsch gelernt. (regular)\r\n2. Er trinkt Kaffee.\r\n    - Er hat Kaffee getrunken. (irregular)\r\n3.

It is usually indicated by adding an \"-s\" or \"-es\" ending to the end of a noun or a noun phrase. The genitive is also used after certain prepositions and verbs, and can be used to replace possessive pronouns. While the genitive case is still used in modern German, it is not as common as it used to be and has been partially replaced by the dative case with prepositions.\r\n\r\n|                              | Masculine                | Feminine                 | Neuter                 | Plural                 |\r\n| :--                          | :--                      | :--                      | :--                    | :--                    |\r\n| <i class=\"nom\">Nominativ</i> | der                      | die                      | das                    | die                    |\r\n| <i class=\"akk\">Akkusativ</i> | de<i class=\"akk\">n</i>   | die                      | das                    | die                    |\r\n| <i class=\"dat\">Dativ</i>     | de<i class=\"dat\">m </i>  | d<i class=\"dat\">er</i>   | d<i class=\"dat\">em</i> | de<i class=\"dat\">n</i> |\r\n| <i class=\"gen\">Genitiv</i>     | de<i class=\"gen\">s </i>  | d<i class=\"gen\">er</i> | d<i class=\"gen\">es</i> | de<i class=\"gen\">r</i> |\r\n\r\n**Beispiele**   \r\n1.

It is commonly used in written texts, formal speech, and in some regions of Germany in spoken language.\r\n\r\nThe Präteritum tense is formed by conjugating the verb stem and adding specific endings depending on the subject. For example, the verb \"sprechen\" (to speak) in Präteritum is:\r\n\r\nich sprach (I spoke)\r\ndu sprachst (you spoke)\r\ner/sie/es sprach (he/she/it spoke)\r\nwir sprachen (we spoke)\r\nihr spracht (you all spoke)\r\nsie sprachen (they spoke)\r\n\r\nIn spoken German, the Präteritum tense is often replaced by the Perfekt tense, which is formed with an auxiliary verb (usually \"haben\" or \"sein\") and the past participle of the main verb. The Perfekt tense is used in everyday conversation and is considered more colloquial than the Präteritum tense.\r\n\r\nAs they are often used in fairy tales (märchen) one of the best ways to study Präteritum is to read fairy tales.\r\n\r\n**Die Maus und der Löwe**  \r\nEs war einmal eine kleine Maus, die in einem Wald <i class=\"prat\">lebte.</i> Eines Tages traf</i> sie auf einen Löwen, der vor ihr <i class=\"prat\">brüllte</i> und sie zu fressen <i class=\"prat\">drohte.</i> Die Maus aber <i class=\"prat\">sagte:</i> \"Bitte fress mich nicht, Löwe. Ich bin so klein und würde dir kaum schmecken. Aber wenn du mich verschonst, verspreche ich dir, dass ich dir eines Tages helfen werde.\"\r\n\r\nDer Löwe <i class=\"prat\">lachte</i> über die Maus, aber <i class=\"prat\">ließ</i> sie am Leben. Einige Zeit später wurde der Löwe in einem Netz gefangen und konnte sich nicht befreien. Die Maus <i class=\"prat\">hörte</i> ihn brüllen und <i class=\"prat\">eilte</i> herbei. Sie <i class=\"prat\">sah</i> den Löwen in Not und begann, das Netz mit ihren scharfen Zähnen zu zerschneiden. So <i class=\"prat\">konnte</i> der Löwe sich befreien und <i class=\"prat\">dankte</i> der Maus für ihre Hilfe.\r\n\r\nSeitdem waren die Maus und der Löwe gute Freunde und halfen sich immer wieder gegenseitig.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"hidden\">\r\n- summary of all caes \r\n- Prepositions and their usage with different cases\r\n\r\n- Verb conjugation present, past and future\r\n\r\n- Verb prefixes and separable ebs\r\n\r\n- Directional Prepositions\r\n\r\n- Moddal verb tekrar\r\n\r\n- Reflexiv verb with complex sentences\r\n\r\n- Comparative / superlative\r\n\r\n- Adverb usage and placement in sentence\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n","dir":"/blog/documentation/deutsch","path":"/blog/documentation/deutsch/Deutsch_B1.1","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-05-29T13:27:30.887Z","updatedAt":"2024-03-23T16:47:11.846Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1715292462560},"$loki":38},{"slug":"Deutsch_B2.1","description":null,"template":1.2,"isVisible":true,"title":"Deutsch B2.1","date":"2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","version":1,"language":"de","type":"log","tags":"notes; language; course;","img":null,"toc":[{"id":"passiversatzformen-dsh","depth":2,"text":"Passiversatzformen (DSH)"},{"id":"passivform","depth":2,"text":"Passivform"},{"id":"satzstruktur-vi-konditionalsatze","depth":2,"text":"Satzstruktur VI: Konditionalsatze"},{"id":"satzstruktur-v-konsekutivsatze","depth":2,"text":"Satzstruktur V: Konsekutivsatze"},{"id":"satzstruktur-iv-modalesatze","depth":2,"text":"Satzstruktur IV: Modalesatze"},{"id":"doppelkonjuktionen","depth":2,"text":"Doppelkonjuktionen"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"passiversatzformen-dsh"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#passiversatzformen-dsh","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Passiversatzformen (DSH)"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\"Passiversatzformen\" in German refers to constructions that are used as alternatives to the typical passive voice structure.

These are constructions that convey a passive-like meaning without using the standard \"werden\" (to be) + past participle combination. Instead, they often involve using reflexive pronouns or certain verbs.\r\n\r\nIn English, \"Passiversatzformen\" translates to \"passive substitute forms\" or \"alternative passive constructions.\" These constructions are used when speakers want to express a passive idea but choose to do so in a different grammatical structure.\r\n\r\n| Formulierung            | Beispiel                                        | Meaning (Bedeutung)                     |\r\n| :---------------        | :-------------------                            | :----                                   |\r\n| Aktiv + modalverb       | Man kann die Kopie nicht nur einfach lesen.     | können                                  |\r\n| Passiv + modalverb      | Die Kopie kann nur schwer gelesen werden.       | können                                  |\r\n| sein + zu + infinitiv   | Die Kopie ist nur schwer zu lesen.              | passiversatz (können / müssen / sollen) |\r\n| sich lassen + infinitiv | Die Kopie lässt sich nur schwer lesen.          | passiversatz (können)                   |\r\n| adjektiv + suffix       | Das Kopie ist nur schwer lesbar.                | passiversatz (können)                   |\r\n\r\n\r\n## Passivform\r\nPassive voice is a grammatical construction in which the subject of a sentence is the recipient of the action, rather than the performer of the action. In other words, in a passive sentence, the thing being acted upon is the grammatical subject of the sentence, while the agent (the entity that is performing the action) is often relegated to a prepositional phrase or omitted altogether.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the active sentence \"John ate the pizza,\" \"John\" is the subject and the performer of the action, while \"pizza\" is the object and the thing being acted upon. In the passive version of this sentence, \"The pizza was eaten by John,\" \"pizza\" becomes the subject, while \"John\" is introduced via a prepositional phrase.\r\n\r\nPassive voice is often used when the speaker wants to emphasize the thing being acted upon or when the performer of the action is unknown, irrelevant, or intentionally being obscured. However, passive voice can sometimes make sentences more wordy and harder to understand, so it's important to use it judiciously.\r\n\r\nIn German language the passiv structure has those properties.\r\n\r\n1. Use of the subject is not obligatory in passive sentence. However, it could be done in this way:\r\n    - Subjekt im A-Satz -> von + D im P-Satz \r\n\r\n2. Accusative object in active sentence becomes subject in passive sentence.\r\n    - Akk-Obj. im A-Satz -> Subjekt im P-Satz\r\n\r\n3. In passiv sentence everytime we have always one more verb.\r\n    - werden + Partizip II\r\n    - sein + Partizip II + worden\r\n    - werden + Partizip II + Inf. von werden\r\n\r\nMemorizing all time forms at the same time may result in confusion. The most often used forms of the Passive voice are `Präsens` and `Präteritum`. Therefore I recommend to learn the most common two forms first, and when you feel confortable with the use of these time forms. You can check the other ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Zeit              | Tempus              | Aktiv Beispiel                    | Passiv Beispiel                     |\r\n| :---------------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |  \r\n| die Gegenwart     | das Präsens         | Man liest das Buch.               | Das Buch wird gelesen.              |\r\n| die Vergangenheit | das Präteritum      | Man las das Buch.                 | Das Buch wurde gelesen.             |\r\n\r\n**Umformulierung**   \r\n<i class=\"hl\">Ich fahre meine Mutter ins Krankenhaus.</i>\r\n1.

In German, they often use subordinating conjunctions like \"wenn\", \"falls\", and \"sofern\", as well as prepositions like \"bei\", \"im Falle\", \"mit\", and \"ohne\". Here's an explanation of each:\r\n\r\n| Konnekteren               | Meaning                      | Example                                                |\r\n|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| wenn                      | If                           | Wenn ich Zeit habe, werde ich ins Kino gehen.          |\r\n| falls                     | If                           | Falls es regnet, bleiben wir zu Hause.                 |\r\n| sofern                    | Provided that, as long as   | Ich komme zur Party, sofern ich eingeladen werde.       |\r\n\r\n| Preposition  | Meaning            | Example                                              |\r\n|--------------|-----------------   |------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| bei          | In the case of, at | Bei Regen nehmen wir einen Regenschirm mit.          |\r\n| im Falle     | In the event of    | Im Falle eines Unfalls, rufen Sie bitte die Polizei. |\r\n| im Falle     | In the event of    | Im Falle eines Unfalls, rufen Sie bitte die Polizei. |\r\n| mit          | With               | Mit genügend Vorbereitung, können wir das schaffen.  |\r\n| ohne         | Without            | Ohne deine Hilfe schaffen wir es nicht.              |\r\n\r\n\r\nThese conjunctions and prepositions are used to introduce the conditional clause, which is followed by the main clause indicating the consequence or result.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n1. Wenn es regnet, werde ich zu Hause bleiben. (If it rains, I will stay at home.)\r\n2. Bei gutem Wetter gehen wir spazieren. (In the case of good weather, we'll go for a walk.)\r\n3. Falls du kommst, lade ich dich ein. (If you come, I'll invite you.)\r\n4. Mit deiner Unterstützung können wir das schaffen. (With your support, we can achieve it.)\r\n5. Im Falle eines Stromausfalls, haben wir einen Notstromgenerator. (In the event of a power outage, we have a backup generator.)\r\n\r\n## Satzstruktur V: Konsekutivsatze\r\nIn German grammar, \"Konsekutivsätze oder Folgesätze\" (consecutive clauses) are subordinate clauses that express a consequence or result. These clauses typically follow a main clause that expresses an action or situation, and they indicate what happens as a result of that action or situation.\r\n\r\n1. **Nebensatzkonnektor**\r\n| Konnektor       | Example                                   |\r\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| **so dass**     | Er **war** so müde, dass er **einschlief**.  |\r\n| **sodass**      | Es regnete stark, wir mussten drinnen **bleiben**, **sodass**. |\r\n| **dermaßen...dass** | Sie **war** dermaßen erschrocken, dass sie **schrie**. |\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **Verbindungsadverb**\r\n| Adverb      | Example                              |\r\n|-------------|--------------------------------------|\r\n| **daher**   | Er hatte zu viel gegessen, **daher** fühlte er sich **schlecht**. |\r\n| **deshalb** | Er hatte viel gelernt, **deshalb** bestand er die **Prüfung**.   |\r\n| **infolgedessen** | Die Straßen waren vereist, es kam zu vielen **Unfällen** **infolgedessen**. |\r\n\r\n3. **Präpositionen**\r\n| Preposition | Example                              |\r\n|-------------|--------------------------------------|\r\n| **wegen**       | Er **war** müde, **wegen** des langen **Tages**. |\r\n| **aufgrund**    | **Aufgrund** des schlechten Wetters, das Spiel **fiel** aus. |\r\n| **infolge**     | **Infolge** des Sturms, gab es **Stromausfälle**. |\r\n\r\nso dass\r\ninfolge\r\ninfoldessen\r\nsodass\r\n\r\n## Satzstruktur IV: Modalesatze\r\nModal sentences provide information about how (wie?) / by which (wodurch) / in which way (auf welche Art / Weise) on a topic. \r\n\r\n**Beispiel:** **Dadurch** achten seine Ernährung und sich ausgewogen ernähren, kann mann fitter werden.\r\n**Through** paying attention to his diet and eating a balanced diet, man can become fitter.\r\n\r\nIn this example Dadurch indicates the method, and statement answers the question **How** can one become fit?\r\n\r\nModal sentences could be formed through three possibilities\r\n\r\n1.

Man trennt den Finalsatz durch ein Komma vom übergeordneten Satz ab.\r\n\r\nFinalsatz answers the question **wozu?**\r\n\r\nThere is two common forms of creating final sentences.\r\n1. **Infinitiv** : um .. zu .. \r\n\r\n2. **Konnektor** : damit\r\n    |   |   |\r\n    |:--|:--|\r\n    | **Handlung/Meinung/Status** | Wir brauchen einen Saugroboter.\r\n    | **Zweck/Absicht**           | Wir sparen Zeit.\r\n\r\n- **Nina:** Wozu brauchen wir einen Saugroboter?\r\n- **Sebastian:** Wir <i class=\"pos2\">brauchen</i> einen Saugroboter, **um** Zeit **zu** <i class=\"pos-1 inf\">sparen</i>.\r\n- **Sebastian:** Ich <i class=\"pos2\">möchte</i> einen Saugroboter <i class=\"pos-1 inf\">kaufen</i>, <i class=\"kon\">damit</i> wir Zeit <i class=\"pos-1\">sparen</i>.\r\n\r\n**Beispiele:**  \r\n- Ich lerne Deutsch, <i class=\"kon\">**damit**</i> ich mich auf Reisen verständigen <i class=\"pos-1\">kann</i>.\r\n- Er spart Geld, **um** sich später ein Haus kaufen **zu** <i class=\"pos-1 inf\">können</i>.\r\n- Du drückst auf diesen Knopf, **um** die Maschine <i class=\"pos-1 inf\">ein**zu**schalten</i>.\r\n\r\n\r\nDer Finalsatz mit um … zu hat kein eigenes Subjekt. Deshalb ist diese Satzstruktur nur möglich, wenn das Subjekt im übergeordneten Satz und im Finalsatz gleich ist.\r\nThe Finalsatz with um .. zu + (inf) structure only possible with the same subject. If the subject is changing then connector **damit** should be used.\r\n\r\n- Du machst kreisende Bewegungen, um jede Pore mit Chemie zu füllen.\r\n- Du füllst Teppichreiniger in die Maschine, damit ich den Teppich sauber machen kann.\r\n\r\n# Adversativsätze | Gegensätze\r\nAdversativsatz or Gegensatz indicates a opposite condition/situation to first sentence.\r\nAdversative Konjunktionen verwendet man, um eine Einschränkung, einen Widerspruch oder einen Gegensatz auszudrücken. Zwei Konjunktionen, die man oft benutzt, sind aber und doch.\r\n\r\nSome of the commonly used Adversativsatz connectors are: **aber, doch, jedoch**\r\n\r\n**Beispiele:**  \r\n- Ich möchte eine eigene Praxis eröffnen, <i class=\"kon\">aber</i> ich habe nicht genug Geld.\r\n- Ich möchte eine eigene Praxis eröffnen, <i class=\"kon\">doch</i> ich habe nicht genug Geld.\r\n- Ich möchte eine eigene Praxis eröffnen, <i class=\"kon\">jedoch</i> habe ich nicht genug Geld.\r\n\r\nDie Konjunktionen aber und doch stehen zwischen zwei Hauptsätzen. In beiden Hauptsätzen verändert sich die Reihenfolge der Satzteile nicht, wenn man die Sätze mit aber und doch  verbindet. Deshalb sagt man, dass aber auf Position 0 steht.\r\n\r\n| Satz I | Satz II  |\r\n| :--    | :--      |\r\n| Ich bin kein reicher Mann. | Ich kann viel arbeiten.\r\n- Ich bin kein reicher Mann, **aber** ich kann viel arbeiten.\r\n- Ich bin kein reicher Mann, kann **aber** viel arbeiten.\r\n- Ich bin kein reicher Mann, **jedoch** kann ich viel arbeiten.\r\n- Ich bin kein reicher Mann. Ich kann **jedoch** viel arbeiten.\r\n- Ich bin kein reicher Mann, kann **jedoch** viel arbeiten.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Partizip II als Adjektiv\r\n\r\n## Partizip I als Adjektiv \r\nPartizip I (also known as \"present participle\" or \"gerund\") in German is a non-finite verb form that ends in \"-end\", \"-ierend\", or \"-end\" depending on the verb. It is formed by adding the suffix \"-end\" or \"-ierend\" to the verb stem, and can function as an adjective, a noun or a verb.\r\n\r\nAs an adjective, Partizip I describes an **ongoing action**, state or condition. It can be used to describe a person, an object or a situation. As partizip I converts verb to an adjektiv it is also followed by adjective declination:   \r\n\r\nlauf**end**e Nase (running nose)  \r\narbeit**ende**r Mensch (working person)  \r\nschwing**end**e Hängematte (swinging hammock)  \r\n\r\nNur der _Denk**end**e_ erlebt sein Leben, am Gedankenlosen zieht es vorbei.   \r\n(Only the thinking one experiences the life, it passes by the thoughtless one.)  \r\n-Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, 1893\r\n\r\n## Zeitform IV: Futur I\r\nIn German, the future tense is usually formed using the auxiliary verb **werden** (to become) followed by the infinitive form of the main verb.\r\n\r\nThe use case of Futur I is to describe **predictions**, **assumptions** or **planned** tasks in the future. For regular tasks Präsens is often used.\r\n\r\nTo form the future tense, you need to use the appropriate form of \"werden\" followed by the infinitive form of the main verb. For example:\r\n\r\n**Beispiele**  \r\n- Ich <i class=\"pos2\">werde</i> morgen ins Kino <i class=\"pos-1\">gehen</i>. (I will go to the cinema tomorrow.)\r\n- Du <i class=\"pos2\">wirst</i> bald 18 Jahre alt <i class=\"pos-1\">sein</i>. (You will soon be 18 years old.)\r\n- Er <i class=\"pos2\">wird</i> nächstes Jahr seinen Job <i class=\"pos-1\">wechseln</i>. (He will change his job next year.)\r\n- Wir <i class=\"pos2\">werden</i> nächste Woche in den Urlaub <i class=\"pos-1\">fahren</i>. (We will go on holiday next week.)\r\n- Ihr <i class=\"pos2\">werdet</i> heute Abend viel Spaß <i class=\"pos-1\">haben</i>. (You will have a lot of fun tonight.)\r\n- Sie <i class=\"pos2\">werden</i> in Zukunft mehr Zeit für sich <i class=\"pos-1\">haben</i>. (They will have more time for themselves in the future.)\r\n\r\nNote that the future tense can also be expressed using the present tense, especially in spoken German. For example, instead of saying \"Ich werde morgen ins Kino gehen\" you could also say \"Ich gehe morgen ins Kino\", which means the same thing.\r\n\r\n## Zeitform III: Plusquamperfekt\r\nThe Plusquamperfekt (Pluperfect) is a past tense in German that describes an action that had already happened before another action in the past. It is formed by using the auxiliary verb \"haben\" or \"sein\" in the Imperfekt (simple past) tense and adding the past participle of the main verb.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plusquamperfekt is a past tense in German that describes an action that had already happened before another action in the past. It is formed by using the auxiliary verb **haben** or **sein** and adding the past participle of the main verb.  The choice of auxiliary verb depends on the main verb. Verbs of **movement**, **change of state** or **reflexive verbs** usually use **sein**, while all other verbs use **haben**.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Plusquamperfekt is as follows:\r\nWith the auxiliary verb **haben**:\r\n- Ich <i class=\"pos2 prat\">hatte</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gearbeitet</i>. (I had worked.)\r\n- Du <i class=\"pos2 prat\">hattest</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gegessen</i>. (You had eaten.)\r\n- Er <i class=\"pos2 prat\">hatte</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">geschlafen</i>. (He had slept.)\r\n- Wir <i class=\"pos2 prat\">hatten</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">getanzt</i>. (We had danced.)\r\n- Ihr <i class=\"pos2 prat\">hattet</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gelacht</i>. (You had laughed.)\r\n- Sie <i class=\"pos2 prat\">hatten</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gesungen</i>. (They had sung.)\r\n\r\n With the auxiliary verb **sein**:\r\n- Ich <i class=\"pos2 prat\">war</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gegangen</i>. (I had gone.)\r\n- Du <i class=\"pos2 prat\">warst</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gekommen</i>. (You had come.)\r\n- Er <i class=\"pos2 prat\">war</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gefallen</i>. (He had fallen.)\r\n- Wir <i class=\"pos2 prat\">waren</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gelaufen</i>. (We had run.)\r\n- Ihr <i class=\"pos2 prat\">wart</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">geschwommen</i>. (You had swum.)\r\n- Sie <i class=\"pos2 prat\">waren</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">geflogen</i>. (They had flown.)\r\n\r\nThe Plusquamperfekt is often used in combination with the Perfekt tense to describe a sequence of past events. For example:\r\n\r\n- Du <i class=\"pos2 prat\">hattest</i> <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gegessen</i>, bevor du zum Bahnhof <i class=\"pos-1 par2\">gegangen</i> <i class=\"pos-1\">bist</i>.

Relative clauses provide additional information about a noun in the main clause and are introduced by relative pronouns such as \"der,\" \"die,\" \"das,\" \"welcher,\" \"welche,\" \"welches,\" etc. These pronouns are used to refer back to a noun in the main clause, connecting the two clauses.\r\n\r\n__Here's a simple example in English:__\r\n\r\nMain clause: The book is interesting.  \r\nRelative clause: The book <i class=\"hl\">that I bought yesterday is interesting.</i>\r\n\r\n__In German:__\r\n\r\nHauptsatz: Das Buch <i class=\"pos2\">ist</i> interessant.  \r\nRelativsatz: __Das__ Buch, <i class=\"hl\"> __das__ ich gestern gekauft <i class=\"pos-1\">habe</i>, <i class=\"pos2\">ist</i> interessant.  </i>\r\n\r\nIn this example, \"das ich gestern gekauft habe\" (that I bought yesterday) is the relative clause, providing additional information about the noun \"Buch\" (book) in the main clause. The relative pronoun \"das\" is used to connect the two clauses.\r\n\r\nIt's important to match the __gender__, __number__, and __case__ of the relative pronoun with the noun it refers to in the main clause. The choice of the relative pronoun depends on the gender and case of the noun, as well as whether the noun is a person or a thing.\r\n\r\n| Case            | Masculine            | Feminine             | Neuter               | Plural               |\r\n|:----------------|:---------------------|:---------------------|:---------------------|:---------------------|\r\n| Nominative      | der                  | die                  | das                  | die                  |\r\n| Accusative      | den                  | die                  | das                  | die                  |\r\n| Dative          | dem                  | der                  | dem                  | denen                |\r\n| Genitive        | dessen               | deren                | dessen               | deren                |\r\n\r\nThis table shows the declension of relative pronouns based on gender and case. Note that the plural form for the dative and genitive cases is the same: \"denen\" for dative and \"deren\" for genitive. The relative pronouns in the genitive case (dessen and deren) indicate possession or association.\r\n\r\n| Main Clause          | Relative Clause                                  | Relative Pronoun | Case      | Question       |\r\n|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:------------------|:----------|:---------------|\r\n| Der Mann             | ... der mir geholfen hat.                         | der               | Nominative | Wer?

Am Emde der Einleitung steht die zentrale Frage oder These, die Sie in dem Text behandeln möchten. Bei der Formulierung der zentralen Frage oder These sollte sich Folgendes überlegen:\r\n-> Wozu schreibt man den Text überhaupt?\r\n-> Was ist der Fokus des Textes bzw. der Aufgabenstellung?\r\nDie zentrale Frage wird offen formuliert, häufig als indirekte Frage (... die Frage, ob / wann / warum ...).\r\n\r\nDer **allgemeine Einleitungssatz** kann eine aktuelle Situation oder Entwicklung beschreiben. Er bleibt generell bzw. allgemein, um langsam heranzuführen (z.B. Es gibt ..., Immer mehr Menschen ...). Maanchmal können die ersten beiden Punkte - allgemeiner Einleitungssatz und Thema - auch in einem Satz zusammengefasst werden. Zwei bis drei Sätze können also für die Einleitung schon genug sein. Es ist wichtig, die Einleitung allgemein zu halten und noch keine konkreten Details zu nennen.\r\n\r\nEinleitung eines argumentativen Textes\r\n- Allgemeniner Einleitungssatz\r\n    - Es gibt ...\r\n    - Viele Menschen ...\r\n    - Immer mehr Menschen ...\r\n    - Heutzutage ...\r\n    - In letzter Zeit ...\r\n- zentrale Frage\r\n    - In diesem Zusammenhang stellt sich die Frage, ...\r\n    - In diesem Kontext stellt sich die Frage, ...\r\n    - ..., ist in diesem Zusammenhang / Kontext eine wichtige Frage.\r\n    - Hier* stellt sich die Frage, ...\r\n    - Deshalb* stellt sich die Frage, ...\r\n\r\nsich auf einen Text beziehen\r\n- Obwohl der Text / der Autor sagt, dass ..., denke ich ...\r\n- Der Text / Autor nennt bereits ..., aber ich möchte noch etwas ergänzen.\r\n- Im Unterschied zum Text / Autor vin ich der Meinung, ... \r\n- Daas passt zu dem, was auch der Text / Autor sagt.\r\n- wie auch der Text / Autor sagt ...\r\n- Ich möchte / muss dem Texxt / Autor widersprechen.\r\n\r\neigene Meinung äußern, auf Meinungen reagieren\r\n- Meiner Meinung .

Sie kennen zum Beispiel folgende Möglichkeiten zur Umformulierung:\r\n    - Aktiv <-> Passiv\r\n    - Passiv + Modalverb <-> Passivalternativ <-> Aktiv + Modalverb\r\n    - Linksattribut (Adj., P1, P2) -> Relativsatz\r\n    - Inversion (Verändern Sie die Reihenfolge der Satzglieder, tauschen Sie z.B. Position 1 und 3. Diese Änderung ist jedoch minimal und sollte am besten mit weiteren Veränderungen kombiniert werden.)\r\n    - Hauptsatz <-> Nebensatz\r\n\r\n# Tipps für Präsentationen\r\n```\r\nsrc: Akademie Deutsch Intensivlehrwerk Band 4.

Ziel ist, **Gesamtthema** und die grobe **Textstruktur** (Themen der Abschnitte) zu erkennen. Dabei helfen diese **Signalwörter**, die die Gliederung des Textes anzeigen:\r\nThema:  \r\n- Das Thema ist ...\r\n- in dem Vortrag / Referat geht es um ...\r\n- der Vortrag / das Referat handelt von ...\r\n\r\nÜberleitungen:\r\n- nachdem ich ..., möchte ich nun ...\r\n- ein weiterer Punkt / ein weiteres Beispiel\r\n- als Nächstes\r\n- nun komme ich zu ...\r\n- außerdem, darüber hinaus, nicht zuletzt\r\n\r\nAufzählung:\r\n- erstens ..., zweitens ..., drittens ...\r\n- zunächst\r\n- anschließend, dann, danach\r\n- zuletzt, schließlich\r\n\r\nGegensätze:\r\n- zu einen ... zum anderen\r\n- einerseits ... andererseits\r\n- auf der einen Seite ... auf der anderen Seite\r\n\r\n\r\n# Partizip II als Adjektiv\r\n```\r\nsrc: Akademie Deutsch Intensivlehrwerk Band 4.

These are constructions that convey a passive-like meaning without using the standard \"werden\" (to be) + past participle combination. Instead, they often involve using reflexive pronouns or certain verbs.\r\n\r\nIn English, \"Passiversatzformen\" translates to \"passive substitute forms\" or \"alternative passive constructions.\" These constructions are used when speakers want to express a passive idea but choose to do so in a different grammatical structure.\r\n\r\n| Formulierung            | Beispiel                                        | Meaning (Bedeutung)                     |\r\n| :---------------        | :-------------------                            | :----                                   |\r\n| Aktiv + modalverb       | Man kann die Kopie nicht nur einfach lesen.     | können                                  |\r\n| Passiv + modalverb      | Die Kopie kann nur schwer gelesen werden.       | können                                  |\r\n| sein + zu + infinitiv   | Die Kopie ist nur schwer zu lesen.              | passiversatz (können / müssen / sollen) |\r\n| sich lassen + infinitiv | Die Kopie lässt sich nur schwer lesen.          | passiversatz (können)                   |\r\n| adjektiv + suffix       | Das Kopie ist nur schwer lesbar.                | passiversatz (können)                   |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Transitiv - Intransitiv - Reflexiv Verben\r\n\r\n| **Verben** |            |\r\n| :--       | :--         |\r\n| Transitiv | Intransitiv |\r\n| - brauchen ein Akk. object <br> - passivfähig <br> - perfekt mit haben <br> - beledigen (wen?) | - kein Akk. obj. <br> - nicht passivfähig <br> - Handlung / Zustand am Subjekt <br> - Perfekt mit sein oder haben <br> -- sein Verben der Bewegung (z.B. sinken) <br> -- haben reflexive Verben (z.B. sich waschen)\r\n\r\n\r\n| **als Adjektiv** | |\r\n| :--                     | :--                    |\r\n| überwiegend Partizip II | überwiegend Partizip I |\r\n| - Ausdruck von Passiv und Vorzeitigkeit <br>(z.B. der beleidigte Mann) | - Eigenschaft/Handlung parallel zur Hauptaussage -> __Gleichzetigkeit__  <br> (das sinkende Schiff) |\r\n| **selten: Partizip I**<br> - Aktiv und Gleichzeitigkeit <br> - der beleidigende Mann | **selten: Partizip II (bei Perfekt mit sein-Verben)**<br> - drückt Vorzeitigkeit aus, kein Passiv <br> - das gesundeke Schiff | \r\n\r\n| **Umwandlung in Relativsatz**| | |\r\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\r\n| **Partizip I**: Gleichzeitig | **Aktiv ohne Tempuswechsel**<br> - der Mann, der beleidigt wurde, ...| **Aktiv ohne Tempuswechsel**<br> - das Schiff, das sinkt, ist ... |\r\n| **Partizip II**: Passiv, Vorzeitigkeit |  **Bei Passivbedeutung: Passiv**<br> - der Mann, der beleidigt wurde, ... <br> **Bei Vorzeitigkeit/Zustand <br> Partizip II bleibt + Form von sein** <br> - der Mann, der beleidigt ist, ... | **Aktiv mit Tempus der Vorzeitigkeit** <br> - das Schiff, das geesunken ist, ist ... \r\n\r\n\r\n## Nebensatze\r\n- Kausal \r\n    | Konnektor | Typ  | Inversion? | Satzverbindung |\r\n    | :-------: | :--: | :--------: | :------------: |\r\n    | weil             | NS  | Nein       | Ich trinke Tee, **weil** ich Halsschmerzen **habe**.\r\n    | da               | NS  | Nein       | Ich trinke Tee, **da** ich Halsschmerzen **habe**.\r\n    | denn             | HS  | Nein       | Ich trinke Tee, **denn** ich **habe** Halsschmerzen.\r\n    | deswegen         | HS  | Ja         | Ich habe Halsschmerzen, **deswegen** **trinke** ich Tee. \r\n    | deshalb          | HS  | Ja         | Ich habe Halsschmerzen, **deshalb** **trinke** ich Tee. \r\n    | daher            | HS  | Ja         | Ich habe Halsschmerzen, **daher** **trinke** ich Tee. \r\n    | darum            | HS  | Ja         | Ich habe Halsschmerzen, **darum** **trinke** ich Tee. \r\n    | aus diesem Grund | HS  | Ja         | Ich habe Halsschmerzen, **aus diesem Grund** **trinke** ich Tee. \r\n\r\n- Konzessiv\r\n    Next connectors instead of creating a logical link, presents a contradicting situation. \r\n\r\n    | Satz I | Satz II |\r\n    | :------------: | :---------------------: |\r\n    | Ich habe Durst | Ich trinke __kein__ Wasser. |\r\n\r\n\r\n    **Inversion** means the change of position between cause and result.    \r\n    **Hauptsatz connectors** could switch between position 1 and 3.  \r\n\r\n\r\n    | Konnektor | Typ  | Inversion? | Satzverbindung |\r\n    | :-------: | :--: | :--------: | :------------: |\r\n    | trotzdem   | HS  | Nein       | Ich habe Durst, **trotzdem** __trinke__ ich __kein__ Wasser.\r\n    | dennoch    | HS  | Nein       | Ich habe Durst, **dennoch** __trinke__ ich __kein__ Wasser.\r\n    | obwohl     | NS  | Ja         | Ich __trinke kein__ Wasser, **obwohl** ich Durst __habe__. \r\n    | obschon    | NS  | Ja         | Ich __trinke kein__ Wasser, **obschon** ich Durst __habe__.\r\n\r\n- Final\r\n    Finalsatz describes a goal or intention.\r\n\r\n    Der Finalsatz gibt den Zweck, die Absicht oder das Ziel der beschriebenen Handlung oder des Sachverhalts an. Man trennt den Finalsatz durch ein Komma vom übergeordneten Satz ab.\r\n\r\n    Finalsatz answers the question wozu?\r\n\r\n    There is two common forms of creating final sentences.\r\n\r\n    Infinitiv : um .. zu ..\r\n\r\n    Konnektor : damit\r\n\r\n    Handlung/Meinung/Status\tWir brauchen einen Saugroboter.\r\n    Zweck/Absicht\tWir sparen Zeit.\r\n\r\n- Adversativ\r\n    Adversativsatz or Gegensatz indicates a opposite condition/situation to first sentence.\r\n    Adversative Konjunktionen verwendet man, um eine Einschränkung, einen Widerspruch oder einen Gegensatz auszudrücken. Zwei Konjunktionen, die man oft benutzt, sind aber und doch.\r\n\r\n    Some of the commonly used Adversativsatz connectors are: **aber, doch, jedoch**\r\n\r\n    **Beispiele:**  \r\n    - Ich möchte eine eigene Praxis eröffnen, <i class=\"kon\">aber</i> ich habe nicht genug Geld.\r\n    - Ich möchte eine eigene Praxis eröffnen, <i class=\"kon\">doch</i> ich habe nicht genug Geld.\r\n    - Ich möchte eine eigene Praxis eröffnen, <i class=\"kon\">jedoch</i> habe ich nicht genug Geld.\r\n\r\n    Die Konjunktionen aber und doch stehen zwischen zwei Hauptsätzen. In beiden Hauptsätzen verändert sich die Reihenfolge der Satzteile nicht, wenn man die Sätze mit aber und doch  verbindet. Deshalb sagt man, dass aber auf Position 0 steht.\r\n\r\n    | Satz I | Satz II  |\r\n    | :--    | :--      |\r\n    | Ich bin kein reicher Mann. | Ich kann viel arbeiten.\r\n    - Ich bin kein reicher Mann, **aber** ich kann viel arbeiten.\r\n    - Ich bin kein reicher Mann, kann **aber** viel arbeiten.\r\n    - Ich bin kein reicher Mann, **jedoch** kann ich viel arbeiten.\r\n    - Ich bin kein reicher Mann. Ich kann **jedoch** viel arbeiten.\r\n    - Ich bin kein reicher Mann, kann **jedoch** viel arbeiten.\r\n\r\n- Konsekutiv\r\n    In German grammar, \"Konsekutivsätze oder Folgesätze\" (consecutive clauses) are subordinate clauses that express a consequence or result. These clauses typically follow a main clause that expresses an action or situation, and they indicate what happens as a result of that action or situation.\r\n\r\n    1. **Nebensatzkonnektor**\r\n    | Konnektor       | Example                                   |\r\n    |-----------------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n    | **so dass**     | Er **war** so müde, dass er **einschlief**.  |\r\n    | **sodass**      | Es regnete stark, wir mussten drinnen **bleiben**, **sodass**. |\r\n    | **dermaßen...dass** | Sie **war** dermaßen erschrocken, dass sie **schrie**. |\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. **Verbindungsadverb**\r\n    | Adverb      | Example                              |\r\n    |-------------|--------------------------------------|\r\n    | **daher**   | Er hatte zu viel gegessen, **daher** fühlte er sich **schlecht**. |\r\n    | **deshalb** | Er hatte viel gelernt, **deshalb** bestand er die **Prüfung**.   |\r\n    | **infolgedessen** | Die Straßen waren vereist, es kam zu vielen **Unfällen** **infolgedessen**. |\r\n\r\n    3. **Präpositionen**\r\n    | Preposition | Example                              |\r\n    |-------------|--------------------------------------|\r\n    | **wegen**       | Er **war** müde, **wegen** des langen **Tages**. |\r\n    | **aufgrund**    | **Aufgrund** des schlechten Wetters, das Spiel **fiel** aus. |\r\n    | **infolge**     | **Infolge** des Sturms, gab es **Stromausfälle**. |\r\n\r\n    so dass\r\n    infolge\r\n    infoldessen\r\n    sodass\r\n\r\n- Alternativ\r\n    Alternativ sentences are \"instead of\" sentences.

In German, they often use subordinating conjunctions like \"wenn\", \"falls\", and \"sofern\", as well as prepositions like \"bei\", \"im Falle\", \"mit\", and \"ohne\".
